It’s difficult enough choosing winners and point-spread coverers and upsets when there is one Thursday night game each NFL week.As for three, well, c’mon. Short breaks between games is ridiculously tough when there is only that one contest. And don’t get us started on how we feel about Thursday nighters overall.However, it’s Thanksgiving, and tradition calls for a feast at the table and a feast on the field. Except that there’s barely anything tasty on the menu for the early matchup of winless Detroit hosting Chicago.No matter, says Lions coach Dan Campbell, who has played in the holiday game for both Detroit and Dallas.“I do believe our guys still look at it as it’s a special thing,” he says. “Everybody is watching this game and everybody’s got their families at home and they’re all circled around the TV, they just ate or they’re going to eat afterwards. I think it still rings true that it is special.ADVERTISEMENT“And yeah to your point, to be able to get a win on that day — look to get a win, period — is going to be freaking outstanding. But yes, to get it on Thanksgiving would make it that much more special.”We’ll, uh, bite. The Lions, 0-9-1 and ranked 32nd in the AP Pro32, are a 3 1/2-point favorite — yes, they are favored over the No. 27 Bears (3-7).LIONS, 17-16 KNOCKOUT POOL: Pro Picks took another Canelo-like shot to the jaw with the Titans.
