MILAN (AP) — Roma’s hard-core “ultra” fans were given a suspended one-match ban by the Italian league on Tuesday for racist and insulting chants aimed at AC Milan players Franck Kessié and Zlatan Ibrahimović.The incidents occurred during Milan’s 2-1 win on Sunday at the Stadio Olimpico, where Ibrahimović and Kessié scored for Milan.League judge Gerardo Mastrandrea ordered the “Curva Sud” — the southern end of the stadium — closed for one game. But the ban is suspended for a year, during which if Roma has any further violations, it will be added to the new sanction.Roma coach José Mourinho was fined 10,000 euros ($11,500) for “disrespectful” behavior toward the referee after the game.Also, Atalanta was fined 25,000 euros ($29,000) after its fans threw an object, “likely a coin” according to the disciplinary report, that hit Lazio goalkeeper Pepe Reina, who continued playing after falling to the ground.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
