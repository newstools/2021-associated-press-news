The season is about to get serious for No. 4 Oklahoma and the Big 12.The Sooners come off a open date to play the first of what could be their four toughest games of the season. They visit No. 18 Baylor, which is coming off an upset loss but is still in the Big 12 hunt, in one of four games Saturday matching ranked teams.After that, Caleb Williams and the Sooners head to Iowa State. The Cyclones are also still hanging in the Big 12 race, but like the Baylor, can’t afford another loss.The season finale is the annual Bedlam showdown at No. 10 Oklahoma State, which is sitting by itself in second in the Big 12. The Sooners and Cowboys could meet again, too, the following week in the Big 12 championship game in Arlington, Texas.It’s the type of stretch that could slingshot the Sooners (CFP No. 8) up the College Football Playoff rankings and give a player a boost in a wide-open Heisman Trophy race.ADVERTISEMENTWilliams has been sensational since taking over at quarterback for the Sooners at halftime of the Texas game. Best case-scenario he will have been the Sooners’ QB1 for seven and a half games; no matter how well Williams does down the stretch, barely playing in 38% percent of your team’s games has to count against you.The picks, with lines from FanDuel Sportsbook:FRIDAY No. 2 Cincinnati (minus 23 1/2) at South FloridaOK, maybe this is the week the Bearcats get back to the blowouts? ...
