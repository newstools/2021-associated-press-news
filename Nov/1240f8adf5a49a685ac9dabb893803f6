The Baltimore Ravens do nothing easily.Yes, they have the AFC’s best record among teams that have had their bye (6-2; Tennessee is 7-2). Their excitement quotient is off the charts, and their special teams are, well, very special.Yet they specialize in providing angst for their fans and, probably, for coach John Harbaugh.“I don’t think we’re ever really out of a game, but you hate to be in those situations,” receiver Marquise Brown said. “You kind of want to start fast so you don’t have to do that. But if you’re in that situation in the game, I’m confident that we can get it done.”They will need to get it done again Thursday night against struggling Miami (2-7), which just ended a seven-game slide by beating equally woeful Houston. The Dolphins are uncertain at quarterback with Tua Tagovailoa having issues with a finger on his left, throwing hand, that sidelined him against the Texans.ADVERTISEMENTBaltimore, ranked No. 6 in the AP Pro32, is a 7 1/2-point favorite at No. 30 Miami, according to FanDuel SportsBook.Like we said, the Ravens tend to make it difficult.RAVENS, 20-16KNOCKOUT POOL: No reason to read this after Pro Picks flopped for a second straight week following an unbeaten run.
