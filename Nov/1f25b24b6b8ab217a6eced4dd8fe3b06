MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) — An attorney won a seat in the state senate representing eastern Mississippi during a special election Tuesday. According to complete, but unofficial returns, Rod Hickman won the runoff against optometrist Dr. Minh Duong, getting 60% of the vote, to represent Senate District 32, WTOK-TV reported.  Senate District 32 includes all of Kemper County and parts of Lauderdale, Noxubee and Winston counties.The seat became vacant when Democratic Sen. Sampson Jackson stepped down June 30. Jackson said he was ready to retire after a long career in state government, which included 29 years in Senate after more than 10 years with the Department of Transportation.Special elections are nonpartisan in Mississippi, meaning that candidates’ party affiliations do not appear on the ballot. However, Hickman received endorsements from multiple Democratic political leaders, including Jackson. As a lawmaker, Hickman said he will advocate for expanding Medicaid to keep rural hospitals open and expanding broadband internet. The legislative session begins in January. Hickman’s term will expire in early 2024.
