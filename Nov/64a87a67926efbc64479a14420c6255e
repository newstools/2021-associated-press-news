Gretchen Whitmer’s desk for approval.Bill sponsor Rep. Steve Johnson has said that Michigan State Police officers’ use of an app that erases records of outgoing messages prompted the bill. The Republican lawmaker said the use of such an app interferes with the ability to complete a Freedom Of Information Act request.

The department required any officers with “non-standard communications” apps to remove them by Feb. 10.ADVERTISEMENTMichigan has a history of poorly rated transparency and accountability in government, ranking the worst in the country in The Center of Public Integrity’s national investigation in 2015.House Speaker Jason Wentworth has said when he started the role one of his focuses would be improving public trust in the government and governmental agencies.Michigan is among few states that exempt the governor and Legislature from FOIA.
