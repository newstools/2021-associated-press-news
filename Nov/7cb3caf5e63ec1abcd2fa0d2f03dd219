PRO FOOTBALLTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) — Wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. agreed to a one-year deal with the Rams, choosing Los Angeles and its burgeoning super team over several potential free-agent destinations.The Browns released Beckham on Monday midway through his third season in Cleveland. He cleared waivers Tuesday with no team willing to pick up the $7.25 million he was owed under his last contract, freeing the five-time 1,000-yard wideout to sign with any team.After considering his options, Beckham elected to join NFL passing leader Matthew Stafford and coach Sean McVay in the league’s most productive passing offense.The three-time Pro Bowl selection will play alongside NFL receiving leader Cooper Kupp — who has 74 catches for 1,019 yards and 10 TDs, all tops in the league — and starters Robert Woods (556 yards) and second-year pro Van Jefferson (443 yards). One of those three receivers is likely to see less playing time after Beckham joins the Rams, who have run offensive sets featuring three receivers almost exclusively this season.ADVERTISEMENTRENTON, Wash. (AP) — Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson said he’s ready to return this week after missing the team’s past three games following surgery on the middle finger on his throwing hand.CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers agreed to a one-year contract to bring back quarterback Cam Newton to the franchise that drafted him No. 1 overall in 2011 — and later cut him prior to the 2020 season after he lost eight straight games as a starter.The deal is worth $10 million, including $4.5 million in fully guaranteed money and a $1.5 million roster bonus, according to a person familiar with the situation. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team does not announce financial terms of players’ contracts.Carolina was in need of a quarterback after an MRI on Monday revealed starter Sam Darnold would miss at least four weeks with an incomplete fracture of his right shoulder blade. Panthers coach Matt Rhule said P.J. Walker will still start Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, and Matt Barkley, signed off the Tennessee Titans practice squad earlier in the week, will serve as his primary backup. Rhule wasn’t sure if Newton would be active this week because he hadn’t practiced yet.— AP Sports Writer Steve ReedCOLLEGE FOOTBALLUConn hired former UCLA coach Jim Mora, who also coached two NFL teams, to lead the Huskies.The 59-year-old Mora has been out of coaching and working as a television analyst after spending six seasons (2012-17) leading UCLA to a 46-30 record.Mora coached four seasons in the NFL, three with the Atlanta Falcons and one with the Seattle Seahawks, going 31-33.
