BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Hunters and landowners in North Dakota had a new tool at their disposal during the opening day of deer gun season on Friday.An electronic land posting map meant to keep people from hunting without permission is getting its first use in the field this fall. The law allows only lawful hunters and anglers to access fenced, unposted land for hunting and fishing activities only. “The ultimate goal has always been to keep bridging that gap between landowners and sportsmen and create a communication tool that works for both parties, and I think we’re arriving at that,” said state Republican Sen. Robert Erbele, himself a rancher who helped spearhead electronic land posting in the Legislature.The governor’s office said North Dakota is the first state to make electronic posting available for private land, The Bismarck Tribune reported.ADVERTISEMENTGame and Fish Assistant Wildlife Division Chief Bill Haase said he hasn’t received any criticism from hunters about the system. One trespassing complaint has been resulted from electronically posted land this fall, Haase said.North Dakota’s 16½-day deer gun season opened at noon Friday. There were 72,200 licenses made available this year, the sixth straight year of an increase and the most licenses in 10 years.The state Game and Fish Department has offered refunds to nearly 30,000 hunters due to an outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD.
