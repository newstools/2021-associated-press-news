Michigan State might be fortunate not to be ranked No. 2.Coming off a big win against Michigan, the fifth-ranked Spartans are heading to Purdue, a program with a long history of being one of the college football’s most prolific giant killers.Earlier this season, the Boilermakers handed then-No. 2 Iowa its first loss of the season. It was Purdue’s ninth victory as an unranked team over a team ranked No. 2. No other program has more than four such victories.One of those unranked upsets for Purdue came against Michigan State in 1954. More broadly, the Spartans are 9-4 against the Boilemakers (5-3) when they are ranked but Purdue is not. It’s been a while, though. The most recent of those games came in 1961.Still, the oddmakers have put the Spartans on upset alert. Michigan State is only a 2 1/2-point favorite in West Lafayette, Indiana, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.ADVERTISEMENTOn a college football schedule with only one game matching ranked teams, who else is in danger of being tripped up by an underdog? No. 7 Oregon is less than a touchdown favorite against Washington (4-4), and undefeated and No. 10 Wake Forest is getting points on the road against North Carolina (4-4).It’s a good reminder that rankings are more rewards for what a team has done than a projection of what a team will do.
