MVP!” chants while Durant and the home team misfired.Andrew Wiggins added 19 points for the Warriors, who bounced back from a loss in Charlotte that stopped a seven-game winning streak and improved their NBA-best record to 12-2.ADVERTISEMENTCLIPPERS 106, SPURS 92LOS ANGELES (AP) — Paul George scored 34 points, hitting 12 of 13 free throws, and the Clippers defeated the Spurs.Reggie Jackson overcame a poor start and finished with 21 points to help the Clippers bounce back after their seven-game winning streak ended on Sunday.Dejounte Murray narrowly missed his second triple-double since Sunday, leading the Spurs with 26 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists.Derrick White added 19 points and Drew Eubanks had 10 rebounds in the Spurs’ third straight loss.JAZZ 120, 76ERS 85SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Bojan Bogdanovic scored a season-high 27, including five 3-pointers, to power the Jazz to a rout of the depleted 76ers.Jordan Clarkson had 20 points and Rudy Gobert contributed 15 points, 17 rebounds and four blocks.The Jazz had lost four of five games and needed their traditionally tough defense to return.
