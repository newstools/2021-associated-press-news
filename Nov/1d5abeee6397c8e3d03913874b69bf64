The letter, seen by The Associated Press, was sent by email to GAISF members detailing plans to dissolve their organization in May at an annual assembly in Yekaterinburg, Russia.It was signed by newly elected GAISF president Ivo Ferriani who, since 2018, has been a member of the IOC executive board chaired by Thomas Bach.IOC president Bach cautioned in April 2020 that a “proliferation of sports events” should be addressed, citing climate change and “financial pressure on all the stakeholders”ADVERTISEMENTThe GAISF letter came just days after bobsled official Ferriani was elected, telling members he looked forward “to support them over the next two years.”The first World Urban Games was in 2019 and included Olympic sports 3x3 basketball, BMX and breakdance alongside non-Olympic events such as parkour and flying disk in Budapest, Hungary.The World Combat Games – including several Olympic sports alongside others such as aikido and ju-jitsu – was first held in 2010.
