CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Public Schools officials have canceled all classes next Friday in a bid to boost COVID-19 vaccinations among younger students who are newly eligible for the shots.A letter from the district sent Thursday to parents and families said schools will be closed Nov. 12 for “Vaccination Awareness Day” after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week approved the COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old.District CEO Pedro Martinez said next Friday’s canceled classes will provide “an opportunity for parents and guardians to take their children five years of age and older to get vaccinated.” He added that sporting events would not be canceled.Martinez and Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady have stressed their desire to see children vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when family gatherings have proven to spread the coronavirus at high rates.ADVERTISEMENTJesse Sharkey, the Chicago Teachers Union president, said in a statement to union members that he welcomes the district’s acknowledgment of the importance for parents and families to get their children vaccinated.Just over 58% of Chicago children ages 12-17 have been vaccinated, according to city data. But fewer than half of CPS students that age have gotten a shot, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. That age group has been eligible since the spring.Free vaccines can be obtained at sites around the city. In addition, CPS has set up four clinics where students can get shots.
