HONOLULU (AP) — Some businesses near the University of Hawaii’s Manoa campus are hoping the return of fans to home football games in the neighborhood will help revitalize the community.Many local businesses in the Moiliili area have closed in recent years, from Bubbie’s to Tropics to Sushi King.Beer Lab Hawaii owner Nicolas Wong  told KHON  that foot traffic used to rise when baseball and volleyball were played on campus. He’s looking forward to seeing what effect football games will have. “We’re really excited to have UH football right in our back yard here,” Wong said. “We do have some high hopes that having UH football, having a lot of sports here is really going to bring that college feel, college culture, back to the university area.”From 1975 through 2020, the Rainbow Warriors played home games 10 miles (16 kilometers) away at Aloha Stadium. Starting this year, they are playing at a renovated athletic complex on campus.
