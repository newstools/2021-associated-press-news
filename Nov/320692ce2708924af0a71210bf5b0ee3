JERICHO, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Army National Guard is holding a public tour of the Camp Ethan Allen Training Site in Jericho early next month.The event will include an overview of the Vermont Army National Guard organization and capabilities, a visit to the biathlon course and a look at the construction site of a new Army Mountain Warfare School, the Guard said.

David Fabricius, range chief plans and operations officer, said in a written statement. “Units from all over come here to qualify on mounted crew served weapons and we continue to adapt to meet new training standards for rifle and pistol qualification standards, in addition to many other training opportunities year round.”Those interested in taking the tour on Dec. 3 must register by completing the contact form that can be found online at www.vtguard.com/CEATS.The tours are limited to 20 people because of transportation constraints, the Guard said.
