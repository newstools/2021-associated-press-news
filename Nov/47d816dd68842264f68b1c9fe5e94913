He said that after Cottom was asked to leave, he returned in a large pickup truck, which he smashed into several vehicles in the driveway. He pinned a man against the house, breaking his pelvis, Walton said.After crashing into another vehicle, Walton said Cottom’s truck overturned, pinning and killing a woman beneath it.
