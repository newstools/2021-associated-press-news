NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Belmont University is naming a ballroom at its new performing arts center after country music star Brad Paisley and his wife, Kimberly Williams-Paisley. The private Nashville school says the ballroom at the Fisher Center for the Performing Arts can be used for acoustic and amplified performances, and as a rehearsal space for main stage acts. Paisley is an alumnus of Belmont. He and his wife partnered with Belmont to co-found a free grocery store called The Store that aims to help needy families. The couple also created an endowed scholarship for a student at the Curb College of Entertainment and Music Business.
