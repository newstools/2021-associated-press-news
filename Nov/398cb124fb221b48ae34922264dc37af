LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer late Wednesday urged all adults to schedule a booster shot of the coronavirus vaccine if they are at least six months from when they were fully vaccinated, as Michigan confronted surging infections and hospitalizations.The governor said U.S. regulators are expected to allow boosters for anyone 18 and older later this week. More than 1 million booster doses have been administered statewide. About 21% of the fully vaccinated have gotten a booster, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“We need to build on that momentum and ensure that everyone who is fully vaccinated gets a booster, too,” she said in a statement.People who initially received Pfizer or Moderna vaccinations are eligible for a booster six months later if they are 65 or older, or are at high risk of COVID-19 because of health problems or their job or living conditions.Michigan had the country’s second-highest case rate over the last week, and the seven-day average — 7,187 — was approaching peaks from April and last December. One in every 199 people tested positive in the past week, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
