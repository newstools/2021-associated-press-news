AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Friday called for a halt of construction of a 145-mile (233-kilometer) power line rejected by voters in November until legal challenges are resolved. Mills, a Democrat, supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.”Maine residents delivered a rebuke to the $1 billion project, rejecting a referendum on the November ballot. The power line would serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower to reach the New England power grid.Project leaders had no immediate comment Friday.Mills on Friday certified the vote as well as other election results, including the passage of a “right to food” constitutional amendment and $110 million transportation bond issue. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection on Monday plans to hold a final public hearing on whether to suspend or halt the permit for the project following the vote.
