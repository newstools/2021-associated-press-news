ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland became the latest state on Friday to expand eligibility for COVID-19 booster shots to all adults before the federal government has authorized them.People 18 and older who completed a primary series of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at least six months ago are eligible for a booster. Individuals who received a primary series of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago continue to be eligible for a booster dose. “As the holiday season approaches, with more travel and more gatherings, we are encouraging all Marylanders to get a booster shot and maintain their immunity,” Gov. Larry Hogan said in a news release. “The state has a robust network of vaccination providers, and we continue to have both the supply and the capacity to provide a booster shot to anyone who needs one.”Maryland reports that the state has administered nearly 803,000 booster shots. Nearly half of the state’s eligible seniors have received a booster shot.
