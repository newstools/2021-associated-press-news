DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — India couldn’t afford to lose at the T20 World Cup and it didn’t on Friday when it thrashed Scotland by eight wickets.In doing so, the one-time champion kept alive its slim chance of reaching the semifinals next week. India squared its win-loss record at 2-2 with a last group game on Monday against Namibia. But it will be for naught if New Zealand beats Afghanistan on Sunday to advance.Scotland was forced to bat first and was dismissed for 85 in 17.4 overs. India achieved the winning target at 89-2 in only 6.3 overs, improving its net run rate above New Zealand’s and Afghanistan’s.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
