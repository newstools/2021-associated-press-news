Dravid’s term begins with the home series against New Zealand, starting from Nov. 17.“Having worked closely with most of the boys either at NCA (National Cricket Academy), U19 and India A setup, I know they have the passion and desire to improve every day,” Dravid said. “There are some marquee multi-team events in the next two years, and I look forward to working with the players and the support staff to achieve our potential.”BCCI president Sourav Ganguly hoped his former teammate Dravid “will take Indian cricket to new heights.”ADVERTISEMENT“Rahul has had an illustrious playing career and is one of the greats of the game. He has also served Indian cricket as Head of National Cricket Academy (NCA) with distinction,” Ganguly said.Dravid has previously coached at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru for four years. Under him, India twice reached the Under-19 World Cup finals, winning one against Australia in 2018. He also served as interim coach during India’s limited-overs tour to Sri Lanka in July.
