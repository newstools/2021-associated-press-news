COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) — A Georgia city’s 51-year-old government building is on the way out after voters approved a sales tax that will generate $200 million to tear it down and replace it.Columbus voters on Tuesday approved a 1-cent sales tax starting April that’s projected to raise $400 million over 10 years for the consolidated city-county.Columbus’ Government Center, a 14-story tower with matching three-story wings and a formal entrance plaza, heralded the merger of Columbus and Muscogee County when it opened in 1970. It holds city and county government functions, as well as Muscogee County courts.But age has caught up with the building, which flooded because of water leaks twice in 2018. A ruptured drain pipe dumped leaves, bird feces and other debris into a judge’s 11th-floor office earlier this year. A heavy ceiling panel fell in a seventh-floor courtroom and hit a court official before that.ADVERTISEMENTOn Tuesday, a judge transferred a murder trial to the ground floor after jurors got stuck in an elevator and had to be rescued. The Ledger-Enquirer reports Superior Court Judge Ben Land said he didn’t want jurors to feel anxious about riding elevators to the building’s upper floors.The city plans to use the remaining $200 million for other purposes, including $48 million for park and pool upgrades and $44 million for public safety including new police and fire vehicles.“We’re going to do some road resurfacing, we’re going to invest in some facilities that have worn out over the last 20 years with parks and recreation, investing heavily in public safety and also in economic development,” Mayor Skip Henderson told WRBL-TV.The tax takes effect April 1, raising the sales tax rate to 9% in Columbus. That’s higher than anywhere else in Georgia right now, where the state collects 4% and localities can add additional levies. Across the river in Phenix City, Alabama, the sales tax rate is 9.5%.A 1% transportation sales tax is scheduled to expire in Columbus at the end of 2022.
