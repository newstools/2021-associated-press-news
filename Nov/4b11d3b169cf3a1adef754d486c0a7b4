COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina has recorded its first flu-related death of the season, state health officials confirmed Wednesday.One person from the Upstate region has died from complications due to the flu, State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell said in a news release.The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control has reported 79 lab-confirmed influenza cases this season so far.Health officials are recommending everyone six months of age and older get vaccinated against the flu. This year’s shot protects against the four most common flu viruses expected to circulate this season, and will help prevent hospitalizations and deaths due to the flu.Officials also reminded people that it is possible to contract the flu and COVID-19 at the same time, which can cause more complications than getting the flu alone.“Another reason why it’s important to get your flu shot this year is we don’t want to overwhelm our hospitals, ICUs, and ventilators with both flu and COVID-19 patients,” Bell said.Flu shots are available at many locations, including state health departments, pharmacies, schools and workplaces. Health experts said people can safely get vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19 at the same time.
