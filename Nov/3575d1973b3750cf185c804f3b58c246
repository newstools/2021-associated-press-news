BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentina marked the one-year anniversary of the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona on Thursday with ceremonies, tributes, graffiti murals and emotional messages on social media. Maradona died of a heart attack at the age of 60 after having brain surgery two weeks earlier.

We will never forget you.” The country’s soccer association said the next round of the domestic championship will take place after players jointly form a number 10 on the pitch before each match.Fans also gathered for tributes at sites dedicated to the Argentine great. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
