EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) — An Indian rhinoceros that was a star attraction at a southwest Indiana zoo for more than a decade has been euthanized at age 35 after facing a host of health challenges, including an inoperable tumor.The Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden announced Friday that Mechi, the zoo’s female Indian rhinoceros, was “humanely euthanized” after zookeepers determined that an inoperable tumor in her reproductive tract “was severely affecting her quality of life and well-being.”“Mechi was surrounded by those she was closest with during her final moments. She will be lovingly remembered for years to come by those whose hearts she had touched,” the zoo said in a statement.Erik Beck, the Evansville zoo’s director, said the decision to euthanize Mechi was made only “after exhausting every avenue of treatment and listening to her entire care and veterinary team on the best and most humane thing” that could be done.ADVERTISEMENTRhinos become more susceptible to age-related ailments past their median life expectancy of 30, the Evansville Courier & Press reported.Mechi had been with the zoo since 2009 after having spent time at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Philadelphia Zoo and White Oak Conservation Center.Born in early 1986, Mechi was brought into human care at a young age after her mother was killed by poachers in Nepal, according to information provided by the zoo.
