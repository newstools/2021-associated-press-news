WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — Navajo Nation officials reported 59 new COVID-19 cases and no new deaths from the virus as of Tuesday evening.In all, the tribe has seen 39,080 positive cases and 1,527 deaths from the virus since the pandemic began.The tribe is urging residents on the vast reservation to limit in-person gatherings to help prevent the spread of the virus as the Thanksgiving holiday nears.“In the past, we’ve experienced increases in new cases following major holidays because people let their guard down among family and friends. We do not want any more of our people to be infected with COVID-19 or to lose their lives,” said Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez.The reservation covers 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometers) and extends into parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
