ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — An Anchorage Assembly member has survived a recall attempt organized by opponents of COVID-19 mandates.Meg Zaletel retained her Assembly seat representing Midtown Anchorage with about 60 percent of the vote, Alaska Public Media reported Wednesday. Nearly 11,000 votes were cast in the Oct. 26 special election, with the Assembly unanimously certifying the results during its Tuesday meeting.The official reason for the recall attempt stemmed from Zaletel’s attendance at a public meeting in which recall backers say attracted more people than was allowed under COVID-19 protocols at the time.Those on both sides of the recall issue said the election was more about COVID-19 health mandates passed by Zaletel and the majority of the Assembly. Recall proponents also blame Zaletel and the Assembly for what they say was wasteful use federal COVID-19 relief funds.However, Zaletel’s supporters counter that health mandates for mask mandates and social distancing were needed as Alaska faced a surge in virus cases. At one point in September, Alaska had the nation’s worst rate for new cases.
