Not all is lost for the Indianapolis Colts.Sure, they are three games behind Tennessee in the AFC South. And yes, the Titans swept Indy this season to hold a massive tiebreaker. Consider this, however: Derrick Henry, the Titans’ outstanding running back and the best offensive player in the division, is sidelined possibly for the remainder of the season. So while hope doesn’t exactly spring eternal in Indianapolis (3-5), the team was handed something of an opening to get back in the race.The Colts will start that climb as they open Week 9 when they host the New York Jets on Thursday night.“I understand it’s a really big hole to come back from and win the division, the odds are really stacked against us,” Colts coach Frank Rich says. “I’m just not wired to think like that. The way I’m wired, the way our team is wired is we’ve got a game on Thursday night. We have to come back.”ADVERTISEMENTAs for the Jets (2-5), the only race they figure to be in is for the top overall draft choice next April. Even that is a long shot considering three teams have one win and Detroit has none.Give the Jets, No. 27 in the AP Pro32 and getting 10 1-2 points from No. 20 Indianapolis according to FanDuel SportsBook, some due credit.
