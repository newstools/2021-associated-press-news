No other Patriots defender has more than three.ADVERTISEMENTFALCONS PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Matt Ryan is coming off the lowest-rated game (21.4) of his career. He completed just 9 of 21 passes for 117 yards and two interceptions in the ugly loss to Dallas. KEY MATCHUP: Falcons wideouts vs. Patriots secondary. Atlanta’s receiving corps is a mess after trading Julio Jones and losing Calvin Ridley, who will miss his fourth straight game to deal with mental health issues. The wideouts accounted for just 36 yards on four catches vs. the Cowboys, and now they’re facing one of the NFL’s highest-rated pass defenses. Atlanta must generate more downfield plays to take the heat off TE Kyle Pitts and the running game. KEY INJURIES: The Patriots began the week with RBs Damien Harris and PR/KR Gunner Olszewski both remaining in the concussion protocol after they were sidelined last week against Cleveland. Falcons RB Cordarrelle Patterson is slowed by an ankle injury and will be a game-time decision. He has been one of Atlanta’s most dynamic players in almost every facet of the offense, so it would be a huge blow if he can’t go.
