BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The state announced a campaign Monday to promote electric vehicles that includes adding more charging stations that are available to motorists across Alabama.Coordinated by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, the Drive Electric Alabama Project is intended to both raise awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles and expand the state’s infrastructure for them, officials said.“It’s clear electric vehicles represent the next generation of automobile manufacturing,” ADECA Director Kenneth Boswell said in a statement. “That’s precisely why this is the perfect time for Alabamians to learn about electric vehicles, as many auto manufacturers, including Mercedes-Benz right here in our state, are beginning to add electric vehicles to their fleets.”Gov. Kay Ivey attended an unveiling of the campaign in Birmingham but indicated she plans to continue using her conventional vehicle, at least for now, al.com reported.“My Mercedes is still in good shape,” she said in response to a reporter’s question, al.com reported.
