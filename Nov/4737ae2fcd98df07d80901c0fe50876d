PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Polls have closed in Maine after voters had their say on a 145-mile power line to serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower and a constitutional amendment to enshrine residents’ right to grow, raise, harvest and produce their own food.Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said there were no reported problems at polling stations on Tuesday.The size of the voter turnout remains a question.More than 120,000 Mainers requested absentee ballots, setting a record for a statewide, referendum-only election. But more than 20,000 of those ballots hadn’t been returned as of Monday afternoon.Absentee ballots that are postmarked on Election Day but do not arrive before polls close will not be counted. Absentee voters can submit them in person or leave them in a drop box on Tuesday.Many municipalities are encouraging voters to wear masks because of the pandemic, but voters are not required to wear them.
