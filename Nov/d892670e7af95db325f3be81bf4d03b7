EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) — Australia has picked lock Rory Arnold for the first time since the 2019 Rugby World Cup to start against Scotland at Murrayfield on Sunday.Meanwhile, Scotland chose all seven of its available British and Irish Lions including captain Stuart Hogg.Arnold was joined in the Wallabies 23 by fellow Europe-based players Will Skelton and Kurtley Beale, who were both in the reserves.Skelton last played a test five years ago. He didn’t think he’d ever add to his 26 caps until Rugby Australia recently relaxed its eligibility rules for overseas players.Beale’s last test was, like Arnold’s, the 2019 World Cup quarterfinal defeat to England. He was also surprisingly happy to be called up after injuries to Tom Banks and Reece Hodge.“Those three guys have merged with the group seamlessly, worked hard on their detail this week, and are super excited to earn another opportunity to represent their country,” Wallabies coach Dave Rennie said on Friday.ADVERTISEMENTIn other changes after beating Japan 32-23 two weeks ago in Oita, Allan Alaalatoa returns to the front row, James O’Connor replaces the absent Quade Cooper at flyhalf, and Andrew Kellaway was back at fullback after Hodge was ruled out by a pectoral injury.Waratahs center Izaia Perese could make his debut off the bench. He was on the 2017 tour of Europe under Michael Cheika but switched to rugby league a year later. He came back the next year, though, and has come back from a dislocated shoulder in June to make the tour.Hogg was joined in the Scotland side by fellow Lions backs Ali Price, Finn Russell, Chris Harris and Duhan van der Merwe.In the forwards, Lions flanker Hamish Watson and prop Zander Fagerson continue from the side which beat Tonga 60-14 last weekend at Murrayfield.It’s the same starting XV which completed the Six Nations in March by beating France in Paris, apart from loosehead prop Pierre Schoeman earning a second cap after a side strain ruled out Rory Sutherland, likely for all of the autumn tests.Nine of the XV met Tonga, which was played outside the test window and limited to local players.After giving eight players their Scotland debut against Tonga, coach Gregor Townsend is offering two more the chance from the reserves; Sale hooker Ewan Ashman and Bath back-rower Josh Bayliss.“While there were several positives to take from the win against Tonga, we face a very different opponent in Australia,” Townsend said.“This is a great opportunity to test ourselves against an in-form side.”___Lineups:Scotland: Stuart Hogg (captain), Darcy Graham, Chris Harris, Sam Johnson, Duhan van der Merwe, Finn Russell, Ali Price; Matt Fagerson, Hamish Watson, Jamie Ritchie, Grant Gilchrist, Sam Skinner, Zander Fagerson, George Turner, Pierre Schoeman.
