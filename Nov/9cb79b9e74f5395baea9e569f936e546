ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Three state watchdog offices have dismissed a nonprofit group’s complaints accusing New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas of ethics violations in connection with a proposed merger involving the state’s largest utility company.The actions were taken by the state Ethics Commission, the State Auditor’s Office and the New Mexico Supreme Court’s disciplinary board on complaints filed by New Energy Economy, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The complaints alleged a conflict of interest was created when Avangrid, the company seeking to merge with Public Service Co. of New Mexico, hired an attorney to promote the merger.The attorney, Marcus Real Jr., has previously represented Balderas in some matters and early in their careers they briefly worked together.“We were always confident that these complaints would be fairly reviewed and found to be baseless,” Balderas said.NEE Executive Director Mariel Nanasi said she had “no comment” on the complaint dismissals.
