DETROIT (AP) — A 38-year-old man was charged Wednesday in the stabbing death of longtime Detroit rock radio personality John O’Leary, authorities said. Sean Lamoureux, who was O’Leary’s housemate in Highland Park, was arraigned in 30th District Court and charged with open murder and larceny, the  Detroit Free Press reported. He is scheduled to return to court for a probable cause hearing on Dec. 7.The body of O’Leary was found Sunday in the backyard of his home, hidden beneath shingles, sheets and a wheelbarrow. Friends of the 67-year-old O’Leary told the newspaper that he’d been missing for nearly a week, and had stopped returning phone calls, attending scheduled meetings and posting on his Facebook page. O’Leary was a popular Detroit rock radio personality for four decades. His last time on a station was at the classic-rock station WCSX-FM, where he worked from 2002 to 2013.
