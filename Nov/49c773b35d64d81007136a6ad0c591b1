SAN DIEGO, Calif. (AP) — San Diego lifeguards pulled two adults and a child from the ocean after it was reported that dozens of people were attempting to swim from Mexico into the United States, authorities said Wednesday. Tijuana officials reported the crossing attempt to authorities in San Diego around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, the Union-Tribune reported. Lifeguard Lieutenant Rick Romero said the three people pulled from the water were uninjured. Border Patrol agents took custody of all three — a man, a woman and a boy who were all Mexican citizens, according to the agency.Authorities continued to search the waters but did not find any additional people, according to the Border Patrol.About 150 miles (240 kilometers) up the coast, authorities discovered an overturned panga boat floating near the Malibu shoreline, but no people were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Pangas are small vessels commonly used in immigrant smuggling operations. Apprehension of migrants and suspected smugglers at sea along the Southern California coast nearly doubled from 2019 to 2020, the Union-Tribune reported. Those numbers have continued to climb this year, with 1,460 apprehensions as of July 20, according to Customs and Border Protection.
