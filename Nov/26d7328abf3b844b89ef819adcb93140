BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) — The case of a missing 10-year-old Bridgeport girl has hit a somber milestone. Bianca Elaine Lebron was waiting to go inside her elementary school on Nov. 7, 2001 when she told classmates she was going shopping with an uncle. Lebron was last seen getting into a van and hasn’t been seen since. Bridgeport police tell  the Connecticut Post that the case is still open but that they have no new information to share.Lebron’s disappearance prompted a nationwide search and was the subject of television specials. Authorities have said the girl didn’t have an uncle, and have described the tan-and-brown van as an older model with several sanded areas, tinted windows and chrome trim on its sides. They also have released age-progression photos of what she could like as an adult. ADVERTISEMENTOver the years, some developments offered hope but turned out to be dead ends. A man police believed may have had a relationship with the girl was interviewed in 2003 and later released, the Post reported. Six years later, authorities acted on a tip that she was buried in Seaside Park and dug there, but found nothing.
