LAS VEGAS (AP) — A surge in COVID-19 cases in Lincoln County has forced the closure of the county courthouse in Pioche.Meanwhile, Clark County has recorded its 6,000 coronavirus-related death in the Las Vegas area, home to nearly four out of every five COVID-19 deaths statewide.Louise Buettner, Lincoln County’s health officer, said the district court continues to operate on an appointment basis but the courthouse has been closed until further notice because quarantining made it difficult to continue normal operations, KLAS-TV reported Friday.Melissa Rowe, administrator and CEO of Grover C. Dils Medical Center in Caliente, said Lincoln County’s vaccination rate is 38%, which might be contributing to the outbreak in the rural county northeast of Las Vegas.“We did see this very same thing happen in October and November of last year, so we believe this is likely the natural course of the virus,” Rowe said.The county’s test positivity rate is currently at 11.7% — double the rate of 5.8% in Clark County. The statewide positivity rate is 6.6%.Clark County reported nine new deaths on Thursday, bringing the county total to 6,001. The state’s total is at 7,692 deaths.
