The man and seven migrants were caught Saturday in Cetingrad, near Bosnia’s border, the statement said.No other details about the German citizen were immediately known.

Thousands of migrants remain stuck in Bosnia and other Balkan countries while looking for ways to reach Western Europe. Migrants in Bosnia seek ways to reach European Union neighboring country Croatia before moving on. ADVERTISEMENTCroatia has faced multiple accusations of pushbacks and violence against migrants. Officials have denied systematic abuse, saying police have to protect the border from illegal entry.The group of migrants caught along with the German citizen included three minors. They have asked to be granted asylum in Croatia, police said.___Follow AP’s coverage of migration issues at https://apnews.com/hub/migration
