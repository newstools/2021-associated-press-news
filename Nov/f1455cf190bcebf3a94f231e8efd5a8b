Ward won the last two editions of this race with the favorite and appears poised to continue the streak. After three dominant wins on the main track, Averly Jane shifted to turf and cruised to a pacesetting win in the Summer Indian Stakes at Keeneland. She has speed to burn, and they’ll try to catch her if they can. Keep an eye on: One Timer (4-1) starts just outside of Averly Jane and is also undefeated with a 3-for-3 mark. His main advantage: West Coast turf experience, having captured the Speakeasy Stakes last month at Santa Anita. Twilight Gleaming (4-1) debuted in the U.S. before heading to Europe where she posted a win and a second. Along with Kaufymaker (12-1), Twilight Gleaming completes Ward’s trio of runners in the race.

She scared away the competition, facing only five rivals as likely the shortest-priced favorite in this year’s Cup.Keep an eye on: Hidden Connection (5-2) easily won both starts against lesser competition. This will be her big test. Juju’s Map (5-2) won her way here with a sharp victory in the Alcibiades Stakes at Keeneland.JUVENILE FILLIES TURFPurse: $1 millionDistance: 1 mileFavorite: Pizza Bianca, 5-1 oddsTrainer: Christophe Clement Jockey: Jose OrtizRecord and earnings this year: 1 win in 2 starts; $117,635.Celebrity chef Bobby Flay bred and owns this filly who won her debut at Saratoga before finishing second in a Grade 1 stakes in Canada. She will need a clean break from the rail in this wide-open race in which the European runners figure prominently. This could be the breakthrough for her trainer. Clement is 0 for 40 in the Breeders’ Cup.Keep an eye on: Mise En Scene (6-1) is battle-tested against top fillies in England and appears talented enough to overcome post 13. Malavath assembled an impressive resume in France with a pair of wins from four races, including a Grade 2 victory.JUVENILEPurse: $2 millionDistance: 1 1/16 milesFavorite: Jack Christopher, 9-5 oddsTrainer: Chad Brown Jockey: Jose OrtizRecord and earnings this year: 2 wins in 2 starts; $330,000ADVERTISEMENTThe road to the 2022 Triple Crown starts in earnest here. Jack Christopher looks the part of a rising star with a pair of dazzling wins to begin his career: a debut victory at Saratoga followed by a 2 3/4- length score in the Grade 1 Champagne at Belmont Park. He lands the rail while Corniche, his chief rival, got the worst of it in the draw with post 12.Keep an eye on: Corniche (5-2) is the best hope among the three entrants for embattled trainer Bob Baffert, who has won this race four times. The $1.5 million purchase in April is 2 for 2. The colt will need every bit of his abundant early speed to secure a reasonable trip from the outside slot. His jockey Mike Smith has built a Hall of Fame career on overcoming obstacles like this. Commandperformance (5-1) ran second to Jack Christopher in the one-mile Champagne and is still looking for his first win. The additional distance here could help him turn the tables.JUVENILE TURFPurse: $1 millionDistance: 1 mileFavorite: Dubawi Legend, 4-1 oddsTrainer: Hugo Palmer Jockey: James DoyleRecord and earnings this year: 1 win in 3 starts; $174,086Europe-based horses have won eight of the previous 14 editions of this race and look poised to capture another. Dubawi Legend came a long distance from England, and could endure a long and wide journey here from post 14. On the plus side, he finished second most recently at Newmarket to Native Trail, who might be the best colt in Europe.Keep an eye on: Continuing the European theme, Modern Games (5-1) is more favorably placed on the rail and sports a snappy record of 3 for 5 in Britain. Glounthaune (12-1) is a live longshot play from master Irish trainer Aidan O’Brien. ___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
