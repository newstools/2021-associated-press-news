LOS ANGELES (AP) — Baseball was especially good to Fox, with the Atlanta-Houston World Series lifting the network to its first weekly ratings win in the young TV season.The series rebounded from last year’s contest, which hit an all-time viewership low that was attributed to the pandemic and competition from the 2020 presidential election.The Houston Astros must-have win Sunday over the Atlanta Braves, then leading the series 3-1, was the standout so far in the potential seven-game series, according to Nielsen figures out Tuesday. The 9-5 Astros victory drew 13.6 million viewers — a 35% jump over the 10 million who watched 2020’s Los Angeles Dodgers Game 5 defeat of the Tampa Bay Rays.Last year, the Dodgers went on to a six-game win over the Rays that posted a TV rating down 32% from the previous World Series low, the San Francisco Giants’ four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers in 2012.ADVERTISEMENTBragging rights also went to football and NBC last week, with NFL regular-season games earning the top two spots for the week.
