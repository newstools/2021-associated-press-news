We are excited for the future of BC football under Jeff’s leadership.”Hafley, 42, is 12-11 in two seasons with the Eagles since taking over from Steve Addazio.ADVERTISEMENT“From Day 1, Boston College has been a special place for my family and I and we are thrilled to continue to be a part of this community,” Hafley said. “I am grateful for the dedication and hard work of our players, coaches and staff, who have come together to build a foundation for an incredible future.”A former Ohio State defensive coordinator who has also served on the staffs of three NFL teams, Hafley has landed highly rated recruiting classes since arriving at BC.
