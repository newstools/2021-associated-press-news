CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Blackhawks have hired Rob Cookson as an assistant coach and promoted Marc Crawford to associate coach.The Blackhawks announced the moves before Wednesday night’s game at Seattle. The 60-year-old Cookson also has worked on NHL staffs with Ottawa, Calgary and Philadelphia.“Rob’s extensive NHL experience will complement our staff immediately,” interim general manager Kyle Davidson said in a release. “It’s his fresh perspective, however, that will really benefit the team as we work on this transition. We look forward to Rob meeting us on this road trip and I know he is eager to get going with this group.”The Blackhawks had been working with a smaller staff since coach Jeremy Colliton and assistants Tomas Mitell and Sheldon Brookbank were fired on Nov. 6.
