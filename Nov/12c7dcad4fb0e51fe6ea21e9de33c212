CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Johnny Gaudreau had two goals and an assist, Jacob Markstrom made 22 saves for his league-best fourth shutout of the season and the Calgary Flames extended their point streak to 10 games with a 6-0 win over the New York Rangers on Saturday night.Matthew Tkachuk had a goal and three assists to stretch his point streak to six games, and Sean Monahan, Brad Richardson and Milan Lucic also scored for Calgary. The Flames improved to 7-0-3 since a season-opening loss to Edmonton for their longest point streak since an 11-game run from Dec. 13, 2017 to Jan. 25, 2018.Igor Shesterkin had 31 saves to fall to 5-2-2 for the Rangers, who lost their second straight and finished 1-1-2 on a four-game trip.Markstrom, who improved to 5-1-3, had a big stop early in the second period to preserve a 1-0 lead. Chris Kreider, who entered the night tied for third in the NHL with eight goals, was set up in the slot by Barclay Goodrow on a rush, but was denied by Markstrom.ADVERTISEMENTMonahan gave the Flames their lead with 4 minutes to go in the first period, and Calgary took control with goals just over two minutes apart midway through the second.At 9:15, Richardson got his first of the season when he corraled Oliver Kylington’s shot off the end boards and shoveled it inside the near post. Kylington’s assist extended his point streak to a career-best six games.Calgary made it 3-0 at 11:19. Noah Hanifin misfired on a slap shot from the point, but the three-hopper on net couldn’t be controlled by Shesterkin and Gaudreau ended up banging in the loose puck from the side of the net.The Flames then sealed it with three in the third. Gaudreau backhanded in his second of the night and fourth of the season as he cut to the net off the wing at 6:42, Lucic notched his fourth with 6:47 left and Tkachuk went between his legs for a highlight-reel effort with 5:04 remaining.The Scotiabank Saddledome crowd of 15,879 was as loud as they’ve been all season and it started from the outset, loudly booing Adam Fox every time the Rangers’ defenseman touched the puck. It was in response to the Flames’ third-round pick in 2016 forcing a trade away from Calgary due to his unwillingness to sign with the team.It looked briefly like Fox would get his revenge when he appeared to score the tying goal with 1:43 remaining in the first, in which afterwards he brought his glove up to his ear as he faced the crowd during his celebration.But the volume of the booing intensified as video review showed that Samuel Blais had preceded the puck into the zone on the Rangers rush, resulting in the goal being waved off. As the officials made the announcement, the video screen zoomed in on Fox on the bench, causing the fans to erupt.DOMINATINGCalgary swept the season series with the Rangers and improved to 7-0-0 against Eastern Conference opponents.
