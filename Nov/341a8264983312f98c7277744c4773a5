BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The chairwoman of the Louisiana Board of Massage Therapy has resigned after a state audit accused the panel of downplaying possible cases of human trafficking, officials said. Rhonda McManus resigned effective Nov. 6, according to The Advocate.  She had held the post for 10 years.McManus left her position after the audit, released in March, said the state regulation of the massage therapy industry had numerous problems. It said the board failed to ensure that businesses were not sexually oriented operations and lacked consistent standards on when to dismiss sexual misconduct and other complaints, according to The Advocate. Two other staff members also resigned, according to Jacques Berry, policy and communications director of the Division of Administration. ADVERTISEMENTAn official with the state’s Department of Health was assigned to help run the board until replacements for McManus and the other staff members can be found, Berry said. Neither McManus nor the former chairwoman of the board, Sallye Raymond, responded to The Advocate’s requests for comment.
