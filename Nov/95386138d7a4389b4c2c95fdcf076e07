A former administrator for a Prescott nursing home that had a large COVID-19 outbreak early in the pandemic has surrendered his state license.Larry Michael Rasmussen  didn’t appear for a scheduled formal hearing Monday but the Arizona Board of Nursing Care Institution Administrators and Assisted Living Facility Managers accepted his offer to surrender his license, the Arizona Republic reported.More than 50 residents of Granite Creek Health and Rehabilitation contracted COVID-19 and at least 15 died after management made sick employees work.The board scheduled the hearing and subpoenaed Rasmussen to appear after saying two months ago that it didn’t have enough information to review his license and wanted to learn more about what happened at the home.ADVERTISEMENTWith Rasmussen’s surrender of his license, there was no discussion during Monday’s meeting and subpoenaed employees who appeared didn’t testify.Rasmussen’s attorney previously sent the board a letter saying Rasmussen would not be “appearing to answer any additional questions at any time before this board.”
