FARMINGTON, Maine (AP) — A road project that conservationists hope will improve fish passage in central Maine has been completed.The project is a road-stream crossing replacement in Farmington, near the border with Temple. It was completed in late October. The Atlantic Salmon Federation said the upgraded crossing will reduce flooding, create better road safety and allow better fish passage in Cummings Brook.The replacement follows another culvert replacement project in the area this year. The salmon federation said $750,000 in construction funding for the two projects came from state and federal governments, conservation groups and private and other sources.The federation said the projects will benefit Atlantic salmon and brook trout in Kennebec River tributaries.
