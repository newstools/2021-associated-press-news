BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — A downtown safety program in Vermont’s largest city is being expanded and will run through the holidays, the Burlington Business Association said. Green Mountain Concert Services will provide so-called ambassadors to offer retail, restaurant and hospitality staff safe escort to or from their vehicle, building, or workplace within downtown Burlington from 2 p.m. to midnight Wednesday through Sunday, the association said.The ambassadors will also be additional “eyes and ears” downtown and interact with police, Howard Center Street Outreach and other community partners; de-escalate disruptive disturbances downtown; and direct visitors to parking, public restrooms, and other amenities, officials said. “The Church Street Marketplace is the heart and center of holiday commerce in the City, and as we move into the economic recovery ahead it is more important than ever that our local businesses are supported in having a successful winter retail season,” Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said in a written statement. The program is funded by the city and private donations.
