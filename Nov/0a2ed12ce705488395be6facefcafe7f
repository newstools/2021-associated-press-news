LOS ANGELES (AP) — Santa Ana winds declined in strength across Southern California on Friday and utilities restored power to thousands of customers whose electricity was shut off to prevent wildfires.The seasonal dry winds produced fierce gusts on Thanksgiving Day, toppling trees and causing other damage while “public safety power shutoffs” in high-risk areas interrupted traditional dinners.Winds shredded material covering a big dome built in Burbank as a studio for developing entertainment content to be used in Las Vegas productions.One location in Los Angeles County had an 89 mph (143 kph) gust early Thursday, but the National Weather Service said winds Friday were not nearly as strong.No major wildfires were reported during the peak of the winds.ADVERTISEMENTBy afternoon, Southern California Edison’s website showed the number of customers still without power was down to about 21,000 but power was entirely restored by nightfall. San Diego Gas & Electric restored power to about 1,100 customers. Benign weather was predicted through the weekend.“There will be a few puffs of wind each morning Saturday and Sunday but nothing near advisory levels,” the weather service said.
