PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A judge upheld Rhode Island’s school mask mandate on Friday.A group of Rhode Island parents and grandparents filed a legal challenge in September to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The judge found the public interest weighs against granting their petition for a preliminary injunction against the mandate.Superior Court Associate Justice Jeffrey Lanphear wrote that the court heard credible testimony from multiple plaintiffs that their children were suffering adverse effects from wearing masks, including physical and emotional discomfort and reduced interaction with peers and teachers. At the same time, the governor and health department are responsible for protecting the health and safety of all residents and presented substantial evidence that the mandate is a reasonable and appropriate means to minimize the serious risk posed by COVID-19, Lanphear wrote. ADVERTISEMENT“Even with the recognition that the wearing of masks creates some irreparable harm to students, that harm is significantly outweighed by the harm caused by the unmasked spread of the disease, particularly among children,” the decision said.The lawsuit alleged that the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and also declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus.McKee signed an executive order Friday extending the mask mandate until mid-December.
