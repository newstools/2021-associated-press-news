TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Gas prices remained high in New Jersey and crept up a bit more around the nation as a whole amid continued high crude oil prices.AAA Mid-Atlantic says the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $3.45, the same as last week. Drivers were paying an average of $2.19 a gallon a year ago at this time.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.42 up two cents from last week. Drivers were paying $2.11 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.Analysts say a small dip in domestic demand “may signal that the typical post-Labor Day drop-off was just a bit delayed this year.” If the steady increase in crude prices eases, they say, “consumers will likely see smaller price hikes at the pump.”
