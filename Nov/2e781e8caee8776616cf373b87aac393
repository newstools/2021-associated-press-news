WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Anders Lee and Brock Nelson scored, Ilya Sorokin made 24 saves and the New York Islanders ended the Winnipeg Jets’ undefeated string at home with a 2-0 victory Saturday night.Sorokin, playing his ninth consecutive game to start the season, stopped 24 shots for his third shutout — tied for the NHL lead. Backup goalie Eric Comrie stopped 29 shots for the Jets, falling to 3-1.The Islanders (5-2-2) opened the scoring early when Josh Bailey found Lee all alone in front. His wrist shot beat Comrie high to the glove side at 3:12 of the first period.New York narrowly missed doubling its lead just a couple of minutes later when Mathew Barzal was by himself in virtually the same spot, but Comrie thwarted him with his right pad.Nelson made it 2-0 just 47 seconds into the third after taking a nifty tip pass from Kyle Palmieri at the Jets blueline. Nelson skated in to the top of the right circle and ripped a wrist shot past Comrie on his blocker side.ADVERTISEMENTNelson scored a career-high four goals Thursday night in a 6-2 victory at Montreal.The Jets pulled Comrie with a little less than two minutes to go but were unable to beat Sorokin. Winnipeg managed no shots on net in the last four minutes.It was a scrappy game, with a fight in the second period between Jets winger Adam Lowry and Islanders defenseman Scott Mayfield. There were a number of other near-fights and countless face-washes in scrums.A couple of streaks for the Jets came to an end. They had been riding an eight-game point streak (6-0-2) since opening the season with a pair of regulation losses, and they had been undefeated at home (4-0-0).The Islanders outshot the Jets 31-24. Winnipeg had defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 5-1 less than 24 hours earlier.UP NEXTIslanders: Play at Minnesota on Sunday night, the 10th game of a 13-game road trip to start the season while construction on their new home arena is completed.
