GODDARD, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas school district has agreed to resume allowing its libraries to check out books that a parent had challenged.The Goddard district wrote in an email that school principals and librarians made the decision during a meeting Wednesday. The email encouraged parents to “contact them directly if they have questions about the books being challenged nationally,” The Wichita Eagle reports. 
Issues had arisen  when one parent in the Goddard district objected to language he found offensive in “The Hate U Give,” a novel about the aftermath of a police officer killing a Black teenager. The parent then submitted a list of 28 other books he questioned, and district officials agreed last week to halt checkouts and complete a review.ADVERTISEMENT“At this time, the district is not in a position to know if the books contained on this list meet our educational goals or not,” Goddard Assistant Superintendent Julie Cannizzo wrote in an email last week. “Additionally, we need to gain a better understanding of the processes utilized to select books for our school libraries.”Many of the books on the list feature themes about race, sexual orientation and gender identity, including “They Called Themselves the K.K.K.: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group” by Susan Campbell Bertoletti, “Fences” by August Wilson and “This Book is Gay” by James Dawson.The email the district sent Wednesday to parents said not all of the challenged books were in school libraries. It did not say how many were.Books in public schools, particularly those that relate to contentious issues surrounding culture and identity, have come under intense scrutiny across the country in recent months.The email said families should know “they do have access to the database of books their children have checked out, they can receive notifications when their children check out a book, and that they have online access to the catalog of books available.”The district plans to review the annual vetting process of library books, the email said.
