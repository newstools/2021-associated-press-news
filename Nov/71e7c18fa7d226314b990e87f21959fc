MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — The Manchester-Boston Regional Airport and the Lebanon Municipal Airport are getting a total of nearly $10 million in federal funds to help maintain operations during the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester-Boston is getting $8.7 million, and Lebanon is getting a little over a $1 million from grants funded under the American Rescue Plan Act. The Portsmouth International Airport at Pease is getting $1.9 million. About a dozen smaller airports in New Hampshire are getting smaller amounts. The grants were announced by New Hampshire’s congressional delegation last week.
