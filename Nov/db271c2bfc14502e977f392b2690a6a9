GENEVA (AP) — A new poll suggests that Swiss voters will vote in an upcoming referendum in favor of a law that has unlocked large amounts of financial aid for businesses and workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and also requires the use of special “COVID passes.”Next week’s vote has shaped up to a showdown between vaccine opponents and proponents.The poll for public broadcaster SSR published Wednesday showed that 61 percent of respondents support the so-called “COVID-19 law.” Some 38 percent were opposed, and 1 percent undecided.The telephone and online poll of 23,997 eligible voters was conducted Nov. 3-11 by the gfs.bern agency and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.The law was enacted by Switzerland’s government and helped to offset the social, economic and health fallout from a spike of COVID-19 cases that led to the temporary closure of many businesses and forced many workers off the job. ADVERTISEMENTThe law also created the “COVID pass” that facilitates travel abroad and grants access to indoor dining and other public gatherings. The pass shows a person has been vaccinated, tested negative for COVID-19 or has recovered recently from the illness. On Nov. 28, Swiss voters will say whether they agree with the law, in one of the country’s periodic ballots of public opinion.Opponents of the law collected enough signatures to put the issue on the ballot.A rejection of the law would mean a halt to payouts and an end to the “COVID pass” in Switzerland. ___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic
