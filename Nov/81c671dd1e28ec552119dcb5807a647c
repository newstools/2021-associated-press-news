BOSTON (AP) — The Boston-area transit system’s service for people with disabilities is dropping its current ride booking software in response to complaints of poor service and reverting to its previous software provider, officials said. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority has stopped using Uber-owned Routematch for The Ride, ending a deal that was meant to improve door-to-door transportation service for people with disabilities, The Boston Globe reported Monday.“The MBTA is confident that this transition will result in improved customer service and more reliable paratransit service for riders,” spokesperson Lisa Battiston said in an email.The Ride started using Routematch a little more than a year ago, but some passengers reported being left stranded, increased delays, and 30-minute hold times to reach customer service.ADVERTISEMENTA Routematch spokesperson said by email that the MBTA and the company agreed that stopping the use of the software was in passengers’ best interest.Carl Minkovitz, 77, of Revere, uses a wheelchair and said a recent scheduled ride arrived five hours late.Deidre Campbell, 66, of Malden, also uses a wheelchair and said there needs to be better communication with riders and between dispatchers and drivers.“The past year has been really unacceptable, totally unacceptable,” she said.
