ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico health officials on Wednesday applauded the federal government’s move to clear the way for COVID-19 vaccinations for children ages 5 to 11. Deputy Health Secretary Dr. Laura Parajon said children who don’t get the shots will remain vulnerable. The latest state data shows about one-quarter of the confirmed coronavirus infection cases reported in New Mexico over the past week were among children, but the number of hospitalizations among children has remained small.Health officials in New Mexico said they expect to receive an allocation of more than 60,000 initial doses of the pediatric vaccine, which is enough to cover about 31% of the state’s children ages 5 to 11.State officials did not immediately say if they planned to have vaccine clinics for youngsters or if they have developed a statewide list of pediatricians certified to administer the shots. More details on the vaccine rollout were expected to be revealed Wednesday afternoon.ADVERTISEMENTMany parents have indicated that they are reticent about getting their children inoculated. Almost two-thirds of parents in the U.S. recently polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they would either wait or not seek out the vaccines for their kids. The vaccine for children is one-third of the dose given to older children and adults and administered with kid-sized needles. It requires two doses three weeks apart, plus two more weeks for full protection to take effect.
