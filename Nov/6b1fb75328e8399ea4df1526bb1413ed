ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Federal health experts are visiting the University of Michigan to learn more about hundreds of flu cases diagnosed by the campus health service.“While we often start to see some flu activity now, the size of this outbreak is unusual,” said Dr. Juan Luis Marquez, medical director at the Washtenaw County health department.There have been more than 500 cases diagnosed since Oct. 6, with 77% of those afflicted not vaccinated against the flu, the university said Monday.“Partnering with the CDC will accelerate our understanding of how this flu season may unfold regionally and nationally in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Lindsey Mortenson, medical director at University Health Service in Ann Arbor.Experts are recommending flu shots.“This outbreak doesn’t necessarily have an immediate impact on the broader local community, but it does raise concerns about what the flu season may bring,” Marquez said.
