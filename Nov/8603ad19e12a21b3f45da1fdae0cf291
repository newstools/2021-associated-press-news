Under expected increases, the cost of power would climb about $20 to nearly $53 per month for a typical household, the Press Herald reported.Rich Silkman, chief executive of Competitive Energy Services in Portland, said the price bump is “not only possible, it’s almost certain.”The price of energy has risen around the world during the coronavirus pandemic.
