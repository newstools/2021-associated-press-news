GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — A natural gas company has chosen a route for a high-pressure pipeline in South Carolina after months of deliberations. The Greenville News  reports that Piedmont Natural Gas said the route along state Highway 290 is the choice after gathering opinions form the community and analyzing environmental effects. Some residents and environmentalists question the need for the pipeline. Frank Holleman, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said it’s “wise” Piedmont Natural Gas chose a route that doesn’t go through open rural land, but he still believes the pipeline isn’t necessary.“They’re still pushing a line through northern Greenville County that will encourage sprawl and unwanted dense development in an area of the county that the public wants to remain rural, natural and beautiful,” Holleman said.ADVERTISEMENTA company spokeswoman says growth in Greenville County in recent years has created a need for additional pressure in the supply of natural gas. Jennifer Sharpe said Piedmont has about 90,000 customers in Greenville County, and it expects to add about 44,000 more over the next 20 years.“The new infrastructure project is vital to meeting the demand for natural gas resulting from growth in and around Greenville,” Sharpe wrote in a news release Tuesday.The company said it will communicate directly with landowners and businesses along the route before land surveys begin.
