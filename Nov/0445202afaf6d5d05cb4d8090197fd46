CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Some of the biggest corporations in North Carolina’s largest city are joining government leaders in launching a $250 million initiative for racial equity. In 2020, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles tasked the Charlotte Executive Leadership Council to create a corporate response to decades of laws and policies that disadvantaged Black and brown residents. On Monday they announced the Mayor’s Racial Equity Initiative, The Charlotte Observer reported. Much of the philanthropic and corporate contributions, which will be paired with taxpayer money, have already come in, the newspaper reported. About $80 million in the $250 campaign will come from the city of Charlotte and library system. So far, nearly $97 million has been raised from private philanthropy, including many of Charlotte’s largest businesses. ADVERTISEMENTThe Duke Endowment made a $40 million gift that will specifically go to Johnson C. Smith University, a historically Black college in Charlotte. Officials also pointed out that investments will target bridging the digital divide, diversifying leadership of the city’s biggest companies and Charlotte’s historically disinvested areas now targeted for public and private money. The plans cover a five-year period, and could involve things such as grants to small businesses and providing computers and internet to families who lack access to technology.
