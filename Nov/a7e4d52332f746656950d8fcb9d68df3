MACON, Ga. (AP) — A young man who broke into the home of a Macon-Bibb County commissioner in 2019 has been sentenced to 15 years in prison related to the attempted robbery of a food truck that same year. Xavier Matthew Lewis, who was 18 at the time of the crimes, was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty to aggravated assault charges for firing a gun in a stickup at Lou’s Grub Shack, according to The Telegraph. No one was wounded in the shooting.Lewis, now 21, also pleaded guilty to burglary and other charges in the June 2019 home invasion of Commissioner Virgil Watkins Jr. Watkins told the Telegraph the intruder woke him and held him at gunpoint while demanding money. Lewis fled the scene on foot after he and Watkins struggled with the gun, according to the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies arrested him, and during questioning, he said he was involved in the incident at Lou’s Grub Shack. ADVERTISEMENTAccording to WMGT-TV, deputies said Lewis showed the food truck’s employees his gun and demanded money from them. When one of the employees tried to grab the gun, he fired one shot and fled the scene, the sheriff’s office said. At his sentencing Monday, Lewis told Judge Howard Z. Simms that he had been on probation when he committed the crimes and couldn’t get a job. Lewis said the mother of his child was pregnant and he “had to do something” to make ends meet, according to the Telegraph. His sentence will run concurrently with his conviction for the break-in at the commissioner’s home.“I apologize for everything I did,” Lewis said. “I already talked to God, and when I come home (from prison) this time ... I promise (I’m not going to) do it again. You’ve got my word.”
