There is still so much to be decided heading into this week’s Thanksgiving college football feast.Let’s sort it out, conference by conference.Atlantic Coast Conference: No. 20 Pitt is locked into the conference championship game and will face No. 21 Wake Forest, No. 24 North Carolina State or Clemson. Wake is in with a win. N.C. State takes the Atlantic Division with a win and a Wake loss. If both lose, Clemson gets to the ACC championship for a seventh straight season.American Athletic Conference: No. 4 Cincinnati will play No. 19 Houston. Where the game will be played will be determined by whether the Bearcats win Friday at East Carolina.Big Ten: The winner of Michigan-Ohio State takes the East. Wisconsin takes the West with a victory and Iowa takes it if the Badgers lose and the Hawkeyes win. If both lose, that opens the door for Minnesota and also makes Purdue’s result relevant, though the Boilermakers can’t win the division.ADVERTISEMENTBig 12: Oklahoma State is in. If Oklahoma beats Oklahoma State, the conference title game is a rematch next week. If Oklahoma State wins and Baylor wins, it’s Cowboys-Bears.Conference USA: No. 15 UTSA has clinched a division and will play the winner of the Western Kentucky-Marshall game.Mid-American Conference: Northern Illinois will play the winner of Saturday’s Miami, Ohio, at Kent State game.Mountain West: Lots of possibilities but the biggest game is Boise State at San Diego State, kicking off at 9 a.m. PST on Black Friday. The Aztecs host the conference title game with a victory. Even with a victory, Boise State needs help to clinch its division because Air Force holds a tiebreaker.Pac-12: Utah has the South clinched. Oregon wins the North by beating Oregon State, but a loss sends either the Beavers or Washington State to the conference title game for the first time.Southeastern Conference: Georgia vs. Alabama is set, but both need to take care of some rivalry business first.Sun Belt: Same as above for Appalachian State and No. 23 Louisiana-Lafayette.The picks, with lines from FanDuel Sportsbook.THURSDAYNo. 8 Mississippi (plus 1 1/2) at Mississippi StateLast time the Egg Bowl was on Thanksgiving night both coaches ended up getting fired within a month and a half ...
