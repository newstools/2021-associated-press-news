In another incident at a game last month, three security staff were hurt in clashes with Rostock fans who were trying to storm the field. At a third game, fans displayed a banner reading “one less.” The tribunal said this was in relation to the recent death of a 24-year-old police officer in a training exercise a week before.Top-tier Mainz was fined 8,000 euros ($9,000) after its fans poured beer over Union Berlin forward Max Kruse while he was being substituted.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
