He starts Week 12 ranked second in the NFL with 3,177 yards passing. Brady also has thrown a league-high 29 TD passes.ADVERTISEMENTCOLTS PLAYER TO WATCH: RB Jonathan Taylor. Over the past month, nobody has been more impressive. He’s the league’s first 1,000-yard runner this season and has tied the NFL record with eight consecutive games of 100 yards from scrimmage and at least one touchdown. If he does it again Sunday, he’ll break the tie with Lydell Mitchell and LaDainian Tomlinson — and help the Colts play keep away against Brady.KEY MATCHUP: Taylor vs. Bucs’ run defense. After producing 185 yards rushing, 204 yards from scrimmage and five TDs against the NFL’s No. 1 defense last week, Taylor faces another daunting challenge this week. Tampa Bay’s run defense was the league’s best each of the past two years and is yielding a league-low 78.4 yards per game this season. It should be one of this week’s feature attractions. KEY INJURIES: The Buccaneers got back CB Sean Murphy-Bunting (dislocated elbow) from injured reserve Monday night and coach Bruce Arians said Murphy played “better than expected.” Tampa Bay’s other starting cornerback, Carlton Davis (quad), is still on injured reserve though he returned to practice Wednesday and could be activated for Sunday’s game. DT Vita Vea (knee) sat out against the Giants, but Arians thinks he could return at Indy. The Bucs are expected to provide updates on WR Antonio Brown (ankle) and G Ali Marpet (oblique). ... Indy’s biggest question is three-time All-Pro left guard Quenton Nelson (ankle). Coach Frank Reich said he wouldn’t practice Wednesday and listed him as day to day. Starting safety Khari Willis (calf) could be activated from injured reserve this week.ADVERTISEMENTSERIES NOTES: Tampa Bay has won two of the last three against Indy. ...

FANTASY TIP: Taylor has become the most consistent play over the past few weeks. Even against the Bucs’ strong defense, fantasy players would be wise to ride the hot hand again.___ More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
