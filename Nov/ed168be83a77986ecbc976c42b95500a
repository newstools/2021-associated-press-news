PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Rhode Island nonprofits that have been playing a critical role in the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic are now eligible to apply for a portion of $4.5 million in federal relief funding, Gov. Dan McKee and the Rhode Island Foundation announced Monday.Grants ranging from $25,000 up to $100,000 can be used to provide services or direct assistance to individuals or communities, including housing, homelessness prevention, behavioral health services, access to health care, job training, food insecurity and child care.“Nonprofits have had an immeasurable impact on our communities during this pandemic, and we must make sure they get the support they deserve,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. “These grants provide an opportunity for our local nonprofit organizations to invest in their services and programs so that they can continue to help Rhode Islanders in need.”ADVERTISEMENTThe Rhode Island Nonprofit Support Fund distributed $2.5 million last December.“These grants will shore up nonprofit organizations around the state that work diligently every day and have spent the past 20 months in an unrelenting effort to help those in their communities cope with the challenges created by the COVID pandemic,” foundation President and CEO Neil Steinberg said.The deadline to apply is Dec. 6.
