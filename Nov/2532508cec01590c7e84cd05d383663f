CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones and back-rowers Taulupe Faletau and Ross Moriarty were ruled out of the rest of their team’s autumn rugby tests on Tuesday because of injuries.The results of scans on Jones and Moriarty on Monday revealed their shoulder injuries suffered in the loss to New Zealand last weekend will require surgery.The Welsh Rugby Union estimated their recovery at “a number of months respectively,” which also puts in doubt their availability for the Six Nations.On his record-extending 149th appearance for Wales, Jones hurt the same left shoulder he dislocated in June while leading the British and Irish Lions. Jones made an incredible recovery to rejoin the Lions tour and lead them in all three tests against South Africa.Moriarty came off when his right shoulder was hurt after he was tackled by All Blacks Ethan Blackadder and Nepo Laulala.ADVERTISEMENTMoriarty, Jones and Faletau, who has yet to play this season because of an ankle injury, were all released from the squad in a major blow to Wales’ chances in their remaining tests this month against South Africa, Fiji and Australia.Wales replaced them with flanker Shane Lewis-Hughes, who has three caps, all of them late last year, and uncapped Ospreys lock Rhys Davies.Also, center Uilisi Halaholo will rejoin the squad on Friday after 10 days in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
