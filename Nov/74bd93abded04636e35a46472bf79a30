VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — J.T. Miller scored his second goal of the game 2:22 into overtime and the Vancouver Canucks rallied to beat the New York Rangers 3-2 Tuesday night.Trailing 2-0 heading into the third period, Vancouver rallied with a pair of goals, and goaltender Thatcher Demko forced extra time with solid saves in the final minutes.Demko stopped 20 of 22 shots. Igor Shesterkin made 33 saves for the Rangers.Miller and Vasily Podkolzin scored in regulation for the Canucks (4-5-1), who won at home for the first time this season and snapped a three-game losing streak. Conor Garland contributed a pair of assists.The Rangers (6-2-2) got goals from Mika Zibanejad and Artemi Panarin. Adam Fox had two assists.Oliver Ekman-Larsson’s hooking penalty gave the Rangers 36 seconds of 5-on-3 with less than four minutes to play in regulation.The Canucks killed off the two-man advantage with strong play Demko, weathering the second penalty.Vancouver’s netminder lost both his stick and blocker and still managed to make several kick saves — with his bare right hand behind his back — to keep the score tied at 2-2.At the other end, Shesterkin stymied the Canucks for two periods before conceding a goal 1:29 into the third.Garland looked ready to shoot near the goal line but instead sliced a pass to Miller, who tapped a shot in back door for his second goal of the season.Minutes later, Garland dug the puck out from behind the Rangers net and flipped it to Podkolzin. The Russian rookie fired a rocket from the face-off dot to even the score.Vancouver’s offense began clicking late in the second period with Elias Pettersson and Miller streaking down the ice for a 2-on-1 chance. Pettersson ripped a shot from the bottom of the faceoff circle, only to see the puck hit the crossbar.Moments later, Podkolzin muscled through New York’s defense and tried unsuccessfully to get a backhanded shot past Shesterkin.The Rangers led 2-0 midway through the second period with their second power-play goal moments after killing off their fifth penalty.Ryan Lindgren had just stepped out of the box when the Canucks were called for too many men and Panarian was quick to capitalize, unleashing a shot from near the blue line that hit Vancouver defenseman Tucker Poolman and sailed past Demko.Zibanejad opened the scoring with a power-play score 2:33 into the second after Canucks defenseman Tyler Myers was booked for interference.Panarian threw a puck into the slot and Zibanejad redirected it up and over the sprawling Demko. It was the Swedish center’s second goal of the season.NOTES: Vancouver’s Travis Hamonic played his first game of the season after starting the year on a temporary leave of absence to deal with personal matters.
