TUPELO, Miss. (AP) — A downtown Tupelo neighborhood has joined the National Register of Historic Places.Advocates learned about the designation in late September, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported. The largely residential area includes hundreds of parcels on about 163 acres (66 hectares) of land. Chris Grimes, vice president of the Historic Downtown Neighborhood Association, helped organize the effort. Grimes owns a historic home in the newly designated neighborhood that dates back to 1870 and will now be able to apply for tax credits for some of the restoration work that’s already underway, the Daily Journal reported.He had initially sought National Register designation only for his home, but the Mississippi Department of Archives & History thought other homes should be included, according to the newspaper. Downtown Tupelo and other neighborhoods in the city already have the designation.ADVERTISEMENT“Believe it or not, it’s easier to get a neighborhood on the register than it is to get an individual home,” Grimes said.Mississippi has more than 1,300 listings in the register, the nation’s official list of sites, structures and objects deemed worthy of preservation for their significance.
