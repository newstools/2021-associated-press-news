GOULDSBORO, Maine (AP) — Residents of a Maine town that could be the site of a large salmon aquaculture operation have voted in favor of a moratorium on large-scale fish farms.Gouldsboro held a special town meeting on the subject on Nov. 15 and residents overwhelmingly approved of the measure. Town officials said the moratorium will give the local Planning Board time to prepare for projects such as one proposed by Norwegian investors for Frenchman Bay.The proposed salmon farm would be located a few miles from Acadia National Park. American Aquafarms wants to operate two 6-acre salmon farms in the bay. The proposal has generated pushback from lobster fishermen, seaweed farmers and local residents. The moratorium approved by residents would temporarily stop development of finfish aquaculture projects over 10 acres for a six-month period, Maine Public reported.
