BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — A new historical marker in Burlington commemorates the 1910 founding of the Green Mountain Club that formed with the goal to “make the Vermont mountains play a larger part in the life of the people.”The hiking club unveiled the marker at the corner of Main and St. Paul streets earlier this month. A hotel where Vermont hiking enthusiasts gathered to form the Green Mountain Club over a century ago once stood at the downtown corner, the Burlington Free Press reported. The marker states that the club’s mission led to the creation of the Long Trail, “the first long-distance hiking trail in the nation.” The work started in the Camel’s Hump and Mount Mansfield areas and in the club’s first 10 years, members built 209 miles of trail and provided 44 overnight facilities, according to the Green Mountain Club’s website. ADVERTISEMENTThe path was completed in 1930 when the last link of the Long Trail was cleared to Canada, the website states. The Long Trail comprises 272 miles from Massachusetts to Canada over the highest peaks of Vermont’s Green Mountains, the newspaper reported. It also has 166 miles of side trails and 70 backcountry campsites.The club’s main responsibility is “to maintain and protect the Long Trail for all Vermonters, now and in the future,” the website states.
