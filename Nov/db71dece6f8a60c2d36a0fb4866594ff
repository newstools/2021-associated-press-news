CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire officials warned residents on Monday about reports of scammers sending out a fraudulent letter that appears to be from the attorney general’s office and claims that the recipient’s identity has been used by someone to buy products online. The letter also claims the attorney general’s office is investigating the “unsanctioned transaction” and warns the recipient that accounts linked with their Social Security number will be shut down unless the recipient buys gift cards and sends cash, the attorney general’s office said. Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that his office will never send correspondence to identity fraud victims, or any other crime victims, threatening to shut down the victim’s accounts or demanding gift card purchases. The matter is being investigated by the office’s Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau.
