DOVER, Del. (AP) — Visitors can enjoy Delaware’s state parks and the Brandywine Zoo for free on Friday. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said it is waiving  state park and zoo entry fees, something it has done annually on Black Friday since 2015 as part of the #OptOutside movement. More than 7,000 organizations and 7 million people participate in the campaign each year, officials said. Face coverings are required in all indoor state facilities for everyone, except children younger than 2 years old. Park offices will be closed and Fort Delaware State Park is closed for the season. The state parks fee season ends on Tuesday. Entry to all parks and the zoo will be free from Dec. 1 through Feb. 28.
