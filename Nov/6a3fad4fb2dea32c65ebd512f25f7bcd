ST. LOUIS, Mo. (AP) — Most University of Missouri System employees will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to comply with a federal mandate, the Board of Curators decided on Thursday. Employees have until Jan. 4 to get their final shot in order to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 18.The board’s vote means the university will comply with a federal mandate requiring all federal contractors to be vaccinated. Failing to comply would endanger about $76 million in federal contracts throughout the university system.The new regulation will allow exemptions for medical and religious reasons. Students who do not work for the university will not be affected.
