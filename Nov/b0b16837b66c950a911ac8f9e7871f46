RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A Richmond hospital has seen a surge in cases of a coronavirus-related complication in children, officials said. The Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU said that 15 kids were hospitalized at the same time last month with a rare inflammatory condition in children linked with the coronavirus, WRIC-TV reported. It was the hospital’s highest peak since the pandemic started, officials said. Previously, they had two or three children hospitalized with the condition at a time. Dr. Tiffany Kimbrough, director of the hospital’s Mother-Infant Unit, said the hospital has seen 50 cases since the pandemic began. The condition can occur two to six weeks after a child recovers from a mild or asymptomatic battle with COVID-19. Kids get symptoms like fever, trouble breathing, abdominal pain, vomiting, “and can progress to full shock very quickly,” Kimbrough said. No children with the condition have died on their watch, she said.ADVERTISEMENTAmong the cases they’ve seen, a majority of the children affected are kids of color, she said.The Virginia Department of Health reports 110 cases statewide as of Monday morning. Despite the “concerning” numbers last month, Kimbrough said they’re hopeful that as more children get vaccinated they will see fewer infections in this age group.
