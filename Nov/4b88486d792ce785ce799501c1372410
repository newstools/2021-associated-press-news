BOSTON (AP) — A 48-foot white spruce chosen as Boston’s Christmas tree has arrived in the city from Nova Scotia, as part of a decades-old tradition.This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common Thursday, WCVB-TV reported. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people.It will be lit on Dec. 2.For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reported.ADVERTISEMENTLast year, with many people pent up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree and sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer trees that are shorter.
