WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — Administrators, staff and students at Friends University in Wichita have been experimenting in 70s-style communications in the wake of a computer systems crash that happened last week. The crash took out the school’s Wi-Fi, email and operations software, leaving students and teachers unable to submit and access assignments online or communicate electronically, the Wichita Eagle reported.A university spokeswoman downplayed the crash but conceded that connection problems lingered Thursday. Vice President of Enrollment Management Deb Stockman said the university was forced to take down the school’s network after unusual activity was noticed on the network Nov. 11. Political science professor Russel Fox said that with no access to email or other communications or operations software, “people were leaving notes on doors.”ADVERTISEMENTEven faculty have been largely in the dark about what caused the outage. On Friday, a meeting was held on Zoom to talk about the system problems — but staff on campus couldn’t watch because the university’s system and Wi-Fi were down, Fox said. Campus Wi-Fi had been restored by Thursday, Fox said.Biology professor Patrick Mathews said some staff have been told the problem stemmed from a computer virus, not a ransomware attack that has plagued many schools, hospitals, businesses and government services in the last year.Senior computer science student Kaela Ruggles said she’s had problems accessing her grades, classes needed to graduate and an electronic time card for her on-campus job, which had to be filled out with pen and paper. “Going old school,” she said.
