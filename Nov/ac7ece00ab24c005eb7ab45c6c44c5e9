KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — A Kansas City woman who told police she shot and killed three people because she was “a bad person” has been convicted in their deaths. Lynnsey D. Jones, 37, was convicted Thursday of three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of armed criminal action, the Jackson County Prosecutor’s office said in a news release.Court documents said Jones went to a home in Kansas City to buy narcotics on Oct. 17, 2019. Officers who were responding to reports of gunshots saw her walking near the home with a weapon in her hands. She was arrested and a man who was with her, Victor Sykes, 45, was arrested after a short foot chase. Officers found the bodies of Larona T. Jones, Brady Jones and Larry T. Barnes Jr. inside and outside of the home. When police asked Jones why she shot the three victims, she replied “because I’m a bad person,” according to a police affidavit. Sykes is scheduled for trial on Nov. 29 on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of armed criminal action.
