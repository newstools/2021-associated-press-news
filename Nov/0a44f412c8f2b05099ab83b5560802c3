WICHITA, Kan. (AP) — The largest school district in Kansas plans to open a COVID-19 immunization site after the vaccine was approved for kids aged 5-11.Wichita district spokeswoman Susan Arensman said the school system hasn’t administered any shots yet to the 5-11 group and won’t be going school-by-school with vaccines. Instead, the district will set up a vaccination station at district headquarters that will serve the school community, including students, parents and unvaccinated employees, The Wichita Eagle reports.Earlier in the pandemic, the district developed COVID vaccination capabilities to immunize teachers and staff.Tim Kaufman, assistant Sedgwick County manager, said the district is “one of our big partners in the community vaccinating children.” Kaufman said the county also will hold mobile clinics at schools in the outlying districts. ADVERTISEMENT“We’ve heard from a few. We haven’t heard from all of them yet,” he said. “We’re reaching out to them to see if we can be of assistance, if they want us to come on site or if they’ve got other plans.” Already, more than 800 children have received COVID-19 vaccinations from the county’s health department since last week, when the vaccine was approved for use in young children.
