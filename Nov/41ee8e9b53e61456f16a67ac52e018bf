Stores in Union Square, a posh shopping district popular with tourists, have been targeted for years by well-organized thieves who at times have rammed vehicles into storefronts to break glass doors and windows and enter the buildings during non-business hours. In July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law that allows prosecutors to charge  those who work with others to steal merchandise.
