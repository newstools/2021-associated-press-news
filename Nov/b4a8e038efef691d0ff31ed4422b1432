LAS VEGAS (AP) — A man has been accused of beating another customer over the head with a dog bone during a quarrel over a Las Vegas pet store’s mask policy, according to authorities.Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said 22-year-old Juan Hamilton was arrested on a warrant after the Nov. 8 incident that left the unidentified victim with a skull fracture.Court records show Hamilton was still being held on a $5,000 bond on suspicion of attempted murder, battery, abuse of an older person resulting in substantial bodily harm and burglary of a business.The Las Vegas Review-Journal also reported that witnesses told police Hamilton was in line behind another man when the two began arguing over the PetSmart store’s mask mandate. Witnesses said Hamilton left the store before returning and allegedly beating the victim over the head with a bone.PetSmart employees helped detectives identify Hamilton because he was a regular at the store.ADVERTISEMENTHamilton told police he hadn’t been to the store for several months and then asked for a lawyer.It was unclear Sunday if Hamilton had a attorney yet who can speak on his behalf about the case.If Hamilton is released from jail, court records indicate he’ll be required to avoid all PetSmart stores.
