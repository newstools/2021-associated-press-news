He was given the Roland Hemond Award for long-time service in scouting and player development in 2007, and the following year he was inducted into the club’s Hall of Fame and the Professional Scouts Hall of Fame.Stewart took on many special projects late in his career, including work establishing one of the first academies run by a big league club in the Dominican Republic.
