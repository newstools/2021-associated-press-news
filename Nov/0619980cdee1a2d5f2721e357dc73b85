RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The General Assembly is ready to begin debating its North Carolina state government budget agreement that Republicans hope ultimately will win enough Democratic support for it to soon become law. The Senate scheduled for Tuesday the first of the chamber’s two required votes on the two-year spending plan. The House will follow on Wednesday. The budget bill is four months late and got finalized just a few days ago. Republican leaders didn’t find complete consensus with Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, but GOP lawmakers say there are enough positives for Cooper to seriously consider signing it into law. Cooper’s office says he’s reviewing the measure, which falls short of what he proposed on teacher pay raises and eliminates the corporate income tax over time — something he’s opposed. Republicans ultimately would only need “yes” votes from three House Democrats and two Senate Democrats to override any Cooper veto.
