MADRID (AP) — Worried by a rise in COVID-19 infections, some of Spain’s regional governments are asking courts to authorize the introduction of virus passports that can help control the pandemic’s spread.The governments of the Basque Country, Valencia, Navarra and Catalonia say they are ready to be the first autonomous regions of Spain to introduce COVID-19 passports for people to enter nightclubs, bars, restaurants and some public events. But first they need court permission.The Basque government’s minister of health, Gotzone Sagardui, said Tuesday the administration will file an official petition at court this week. If approved, the measure will apply to people 12 and over who want to enter nightlife establishments featuring music or dancing or restaurants with more than 50 diners.“The trend shows that the pandemic is advancing at a worrying rate of growth,” Sagardui told a press conference. “More than 50% growth in (infection) rates in the past two weeks suggests an accelerated growth of the pandemic.”ADVERTISEMENTThe head of Valencia’s regional government, Ximo Puig, announced a similar decision on Monday.A COVID-19 passport shows that a person has been vaccinated against the virus.On Monday, Spain officially reported 82 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
