JACKSON, Ky. (AP) — A bridge over the Kentucky River in Estill County is expected to close after Thanksgiving for repair work, officials said.Drivers who use the Highway 52 Kentucky River bridge in Irvine should make plans to use an alternate route for two to three weeks, a statement from the Kentucky Transportation Department said. Signs will detour traffic to Kentucky 499, which will have an impact on travel between Lee and Owsley counties and Richmond, officials said.When crews are finished with joint repair and a bridge deck overlay, the bridge will reopen to traffic for the winter. The span is expected to close again in late March for painting and repairs to the bridge railing. That work is expected to last through late June.The 80-year-old bridge carries almost 12,000 vehicles daily.
