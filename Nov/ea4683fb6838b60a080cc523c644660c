A new name appears at the top of the Football Bowl Subdivision rushing chart after Central Michigan’s Lew Nichols III turned in his second straight 200-yard game and Michigan State’s Kenneth Walker III had his least productive game of the season.Nichols’ 1,516 yards and average of 137.8 per game lead the nation, just ahead of Walker in both categories. Walker has 1,498 yards and a 136.2-yard average.Nichols became the first Central Michigan player since 2014 to put together consecutive 200-yard games. He had a career-high 219 yards and three touchdowns on 32 carries in a 37-17 win over Ball State on Wednesday. He had 215 yards and four TDs in a 54-30 win over Kent State on Nov. 13.The 5-foot-10, 220-pound Nichols was a three-star recruit out of Detroit in 2019 and was expected to split carries with Kobe Lewis this season. But Lewis was injured in preseason practice and is out for the season, leaving Nichols to carry the load for the Chippewas.ADVERTISEMENTThrough five games Nichols ranked 53rd in country at 81 yards per game. His average has more than doubled, to 185.2, over his past six games.Walker was limited to six carries for 25 yards, both season lows, in Michigan State’s 56-7 loss at Ohio State. Spartans coach Mel Tucker said Walker was banged up, and that’s why his workload was limited.THE 200 CLUBThere were five other 200-yard rushing performances over the past week to raise the total to 40 for the season.Saturday, Wisconsin’s 17-year-old freshman Braelon Allen ran 22 times for 228 yards and three touchdowns against Nebraska  and Marshall’s Rasheen Ali had 23 carries for 203 yard and three TDs against Charlotte.Air Force’s DeAndre Hughes carried 23 times for 221 yards and two touchdowns against Nevada on Friday.Louisville’s Malik Cunningham ran 11 times for 224 yards and two touchdowns against Duke on Thursday, and Toledo’s Bryant Koback ran 21 times for 203 yards and four TDs against Ohio on Tuesday.BRYCE’S BIG DAY
