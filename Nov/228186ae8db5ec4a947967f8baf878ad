CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Hunters harvested 30 moose this hunting season in New Hampshire — a 73% percent success rate, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said. Forty-one hunters took part in the nine-day hunt, which ended Oct. 24. Most hunters were moose lottery permit holders. More than 5,500 people entered the lottery this year.Last year, the overall moose hunter success rate was 75%. “Most hunters this year were well prepared for the adventure and took full advantage of the opportunity to hunt moose,” Henry Jones, the department’s moose project leader, said in a news release Friday. “However, it was a season of two different weather patterns,” he added. “After a warm day statewide on the October 16 opener, cooler temperatures and showers prevailed in northern New Hampshire, which encouraged moose movement during the day. Central and southern areas of the state experienced milder temperatures, likely resulting in lower moose activity during the day.”
