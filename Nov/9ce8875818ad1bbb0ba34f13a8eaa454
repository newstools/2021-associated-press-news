COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The city of Charleston, South Carolina says almost all of its employees have complied with a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy ahead of a deadline this week. City officials say 90% of workers were vaccinated by the Monday deadline and another 9.7% received medical or religious accommodations. Five employees, one full-time and four part-time, who didn’t get the shots or receive an exemption were placed on a week of unpaid leave. Any workers who aren’t compliant by the end of the leave must leave their jobs, according to a statement by City of Charleston spokesman Jack O’Toole.“Keeping our community healthy and safe is a top priority and, as evidenced by employees’ widespread compliance with this policy, it’s clear that they share that goal,” Mayor John Tecklenburg said in a statement.Charleston County officials said last week that nearly all of their 1,333 employees had met a similar vaccination requirement, with just six failing to comply.
