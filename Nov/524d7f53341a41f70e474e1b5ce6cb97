COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Construction crews have stopped closing lanes and state troopers are stepping up enforcement to help travelers in South Carolina over the long Thanksgiving weekend.Work crews can’t close lanes on interstates unless there is an emergency from Wednesday through Monday, according to the South Carolina Department of Transportation.The Highway Patrol also is sending out more troopers to do special enforcement through the end of the weekend and warning drivers to expect stop-and-go traffic in normally congested areas.The State Transport Police will be focusing on safety with 18-wheelers, paying extra attention to areas where there are frequent tractor-trailer crashes, the Highway Patrol said.A significant increase is expected in Thanksgiving travel this year after the COVID-19 pandemic kept people home in 2020.
