BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota health officials are expecting 18,000 initial doses of the pediatric coronavirus vaccine, which is enough to cover 25% of the state’s roughly 71,000 children ages 5 to 11 that were identified in the 2019 census.The state Health Department said in a statement Wednesday that “vaccinating children will help protect them from getting COVID-19 and reduce their risk of severe disease, hospitalizations, or developing long-term COVID-19 complications.”Health officials said spread of the Delta variant resulted in a surge of COVID-19 cases in children over the summer. To date, there have been 8,841 cases of COVID-19 in North Dakota children ages 5-11, and 22 were hospitalized.The Health Department said it will be hosting an online town hall event on Friday to talk about the availability of pediatric COVID-19 vaccine and booster vaccines for eligible adults.
