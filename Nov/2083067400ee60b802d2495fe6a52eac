FRISCO, Texas (AP) — Dallas Cowboys rookie cornerback Nahshon Wright has tested positive for COVID-19, bringing to eight the number of players and coaches sidelined by the coronavirus for Thursday’s game at New Orleans.Coach Mike McCarthy and five members of his staff won’t make the trip because of positive tests. Wright and right tackle Terence Steele are the two players out. Wright has played sparingly on defense, working almost exclusively on special teams.McCarthy tested positive Monday and said he was experiencing more symptoms a day later. He coughed periodically during a phone interview with reporters Tuesday. McCarthy is participating in virtual meetings.The other coaches who won’t make the trip to New Orleans include offensive line coach Joe Philbin and his assistant, Jeff Blasko; offensive assistant Scott Tolzien; and two members of the strength and conditioning staff, coordinator Harold Nash Jr. and assistant Kendall Smith. ADVERTISEMENTAnother strength and conditioning assistant, Cedric Smith, has been in protocols but was expected to be cleared for the game.Receiver Amari Cooper has been cleared to return to the team’s facility after missing two games following a positive COVID-19 test. But McCarthy said Cooper hasn’t practiced and still wasn’t feeling well. The coach indicated it was unlikely the unvaccinated Cooper would play against the Saints.
