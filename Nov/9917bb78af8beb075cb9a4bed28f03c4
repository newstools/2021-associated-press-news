An employer-initiated work stoppage following the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement. MLB had lockouts in 1973, ’76 and ’90, the NFL in 2011, the NBA in 1996, 1998-99 and 2011, and the NHL in 1994-95, the entire 2004-05 season and 2012-13.STATUS QUOThe NLRB has ruled, most recently in a 2019 decision, that “it is clear that, following the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement, an employer must maintain the status quo of all mandatory subjects of bargaining until the parties either agree on a new contract or reach a good-faith impasse in negotiations.” (Richfield Hospitality Inc. as Managing Agent for Kahler Hotels and Unite Here International Union Local 21)10(j) INJUNCTIONSection 10(j) of the National Labor Relations Act authorizes the NLRB to request an injunction in U.S. District Court to stop unfair labor practices. When MLB instituted a signing freeze on Feb. 5, 1995, two days after the union ended its signing own freeze in response to new terms and conditions, the players’ association filed a new unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB’s New York office. The NLRB issued a complaint on March 14. NLRB general counsel Fred Feinstein asked for permission to seek an injunction, which the five-member NLRB board granted March 27 in a 3-2 vote with Democratic appointees in favor and Republican appointees opposed. U.S. District Judge Sonia Sotomayor granted the injunction on March 31, and owners voted two days later to accept the players’ unconditional offer to return to work.UNION DISCLAIMER OF INTERESTWhen a union gives up its collective bargaining rights, a tactic the NLRB affirmed in its 1965 decision in Rochelle Restaurant. The NFL Players Association and the National Basketball Players Association both used the tactic in 2011 during lockouts as an attempt around the 1996 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Pro Football Inc., which ruled federal labor laws create a nonstatutory antitrust exemption in a collective-bargaining situation. Kessler represented players in antitrust suits during both those lockouts.___More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
