PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — A Maine university plans to use a federal grant to pilot a nutrition program for older residents who live in low-income housing.The University of New England received the $900,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Community Living. The university said the project will seek to address food security and health and well-being of seniors in the state.Nutrition educators participating in the program will tune into a classroom of seniors remotely, the university said. The educators will promote socialization among residents while also maintaining social distance from outside visitors, which is critical during the coronavirus pandemic, the university said.Michele Polacsek, director of the Center for Excellence in Public Health, said the project “is an innovative way to deliver valuable health information to low-income populations.”
