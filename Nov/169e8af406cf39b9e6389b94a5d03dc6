LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Will Levis rushed for career highs of four touchdowns and 113 yards, and Kentucky scored on its first four possessions to cruise past rival Louisville 52-21 on Saturday night and win the Governor’s Cup for the third consecutive time.Big contributions by his feet and arm helped the Wildcats’ junior quarterback outgain Louisville by himself (195-144) by halftime. Levis rushed for TDs of 29 and 7 yards on their first two possessions, then followed Matt Ruffolo’s 43-yard field goal with a 5-yard score with 1:53 remaining in the second quarter. He added a 1-yard TD early in the third to put Kentucky (9-3) up 31-7 on the way to topping his previous rushing best of 108 yards against Rutgers on Nov. 30, 2019 while at Penn State. Levis also completed 14 of 18 passes for 149 yards to outshine Louisville counterpart Malik Cunningham in a matchup of mobile quarterbacks.ADVERTISEMENTCunningham rushed for 2-yard TD to tie the game at 7-apiece and completed 12 of 20 passes for 145 yards before being taken to the dressing room with 10 minutes left. Evan Conley came in and threw an 8-yard TD pass and Maurice Burkley rushed for an 7-yard TD with eight seconds left for the Cardinals (6-6).Chris Rodriguez Jr. rushed 16 times for 121 yards and a 2-yard TD, Kavoisey Smoke added a 13-yard score and La’Vell Wright one from 41 yards. Wan’Dale Robinson caught nine passes for 97 yards.THE TAKEAWAYKentucky took control quickly and effectively behind Levis, whose four-TD effort last week against New Mexico State also included three turnovers. Giveaways didn’t happen as he had plenty of running room and a clean pocket to pass. The Wildcats outgained the Cardinals 511-352 and shut down of an offense that had scored 93 points the past two games. Louisville looked like it might keep pace offensively with Kentucky, but its defense could neither stop nor contain Levis when he took off. That created a long day for that unit and a deep hole for the Cardinals that Cunningham’s dual skills couldn’t overcome. That leaves plenty of corrections to make before their bowl game.UP NEXTKentucky awaits its postseason destination.Louisville awaits its postseason destination.___More AP college football:https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.
