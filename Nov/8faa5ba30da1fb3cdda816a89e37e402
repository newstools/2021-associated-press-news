The 39-year-old will start after sitting out last weekend’s 16-16 tie with Detroit following a positive COVID-19 test. Roethlisberger did not practice during the week but participated in team meetings virtually. A year ago, Roethlisberger missed a week of practice due to COVID-19 contact tracing, started anyway and ended up throwing for 333 yards and four touchdowns in a win over Cincinnati.ADVERTISEMENTCHARGERS PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Justin Herbert. It was another frustrating showing for Herbert against Minnesota, completing just two passes longer than 20 yards. He was 20 for 34 for 195 yards with one touchdown and one interception. The Steelers know how to rush the passer, getting home at the fourth-best rate in football (8.8%), so Herbert will have to be patient against a secondary that should be trying to take away the deep ball. KEY MATCHUP: Steelers RB Najee Harris vs. Chargers DL Linval Joseph. Just when Los Angeles showed glimpses of improvement stopping the run, limiting Minnesota to 103 yards that came mostly from volume of attempts, it could face the rookie rusher from Alabama with interior lineman Jerry Tillery on the COVID-19 list. Joseph must be stout at the point of attack to limit Harris, who is coming off his second 100-yard game. Even with Roethlisberger behind center, Pittsburgh will want a heavy dose of Harris to dictate the pace of play.

If Ekeler, who hasn’t topped 66 yards in any other game, can’t get going as a runner, it will be time to write him off in formats that don’t reward his contributions as a receiver.___More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
