DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Pakistan wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan spent two nights in a hospital due to a chest infection before the team’s semifinal loss against Australia on Thursday in cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup.Team doctor Najeeb Soomro said Rizwan was admitted to the intensive care unit in a local hospital in Dubai on Tuesday, but was declared fit on the morning of the semifinal.“He spent two nights in the ICU, made an incredible recovery and was deemed fit before the match,” Soomro said after Pakistan lost by five wickets with Matthew Wade smashing three successive sixes against Shaheen Afridi in the penultimate over.“We can see his great determination and tenacity that shows his spirit of performing for the country and we can see how he responded today.”Rizwan was twice dropped before making 67, but Pakistan’s 176-4 couldn’t prove enough in the end as Australia reached 177-5 with an over to spare.ADVERTISEMENTRizwan finished the tournament as the second highest run-scorer behind captain Babar Azam’s 303. He made 281 runs with three half centuries and also became the first batter in the world to complete 1,000 T20 runs in a calendar year.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
