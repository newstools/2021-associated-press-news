PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The South Dakota Legislature paused its effort to reach a consensus on redrawing political boundaries late Tuesday after the House Republican leader suffered a medical incident and had to be taken to the hospital.Rep. Kent Peterson was conscious as he was wheeled out of a Republican caucus meeting on a stretcher, but the incident halted negotiations over redrawing the state’s political map. Peterson had played a central role as a special legislative session stretched into two days of wrangling between conflicting House and Senate proposals. Lawmakers had been nearing a deal, but postponed their work until Wednesday. “I feel very confident he will be here in the morning ready to go,” said House Speaker Spencer Gosch.Gosch declined to comment on Peterson’s medical information.The once-in-a-decade redistricting process has laid bare political rivalries in the state’s GOP with a divide between moderate Republicans and their more conservative colleagues.The Senate put forward a proposal that would meet federal requirements to protect the voting rights of Native Americans, but House lawmakers charged the Senate with orchestrating a shake-up by pitting lawmakers against each other in the new political map.
