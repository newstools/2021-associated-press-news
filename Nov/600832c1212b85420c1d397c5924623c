EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — New York Giants defensive back Logan Ryan has been placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list and his status for Monday night’s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is uncertain.Coach Joe Judge said Friday that Ryan had a positive rapid COVID-19 test on Thursday. He added the team was waiting for the result of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, a molecular test that looks for genetic material that indicates COVID-19.The Giants (3-6) had a number of false positive test results in the week leading up to their game with the Las Vegas Raiders on Nov. 7. Judge does not believe Ryan’s result is a false positive, but would not say more about it.Ryan has a team-high 72 tackles. If he were not able to play against the Bucs (6-3) and former Patriots teammate Tom Brady, Julian Love would get more playing time.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
