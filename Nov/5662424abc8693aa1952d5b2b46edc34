A crew from the Coast Guard’s Bodega Bay station arrived about 30 minutes after receiving the alert and retrieved the three fishermen. They were not injured but had to be treated for hypothermia symptoms, the Coast Guard said. A GPS verification tool allowed the Coast Guard rescue crew to quickly reach the fishermen, Lt. Cmdr.
