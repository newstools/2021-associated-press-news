The 7-foot transfer from North Carolina helped keep Auburn in control of the glass with a 36-26 rebounding advantage as well as his work protecting the rim.Marquise Kennedy scored 13 points to lead the Ramblers (4-2), who shot 62% in the first half. But Loyola Chicago’s offense struggled to string together baskets to build some rhythm, and the outside-shooting struggles after halftime were magnified as Auburn began to increase its late margin.ADVERTISEMENTLoyola Chicago shot just 8 for 26 (31%) after halftime.BIG PICTUREAuburn: The Tigers were coming off a wild 115-109 loss to No. 22 UConn in Wednesday’s first round.
