CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — Prop Tomas Francis and wing Josh Adams have passed fitness tests to play for Wales against Australia on Saturday in Principality Stadium.Both were picked in the starting XV with provisos.Francis cleared concussion protocols after suffering a head knock last Friday in training, which eventually forced him to withdraw on the morning of Wales’ 38-23 win over Fiji last Sunday.Adams injured a calf in the warmup and had to withdraw moments before the match. He has trained fully.Wales captain Ellis Jenkins was grateful Adams, also his Cardiff teammate, was able to complete the lineup.“What people probably don’t see is how competitive he is and how angry he is. He’s very physical, he wants to defend,” Jenkins said on Friday.“Quite often, particularly backs get the reputation that they like to attack and they don’t like to defend. But it really excites him, trying to smoke people.”ADVERTISEMENTWales go for a third straight win over the Wallabies, and a second win of the autumn after opening losses to New Zealand and South Africa.Jenkins didn’t believe a loss to Australia will make their autumn a failure.“In sport everyone always gets carried away with results,” he said. “No one remembers the fact that South Africa lost a couple of games in 2018 before they went on to win the World Cup in 2019.“Sometimes, it’s about the process and what the end goal is. We want to win and get two wins. The South Africa game could have been a win as well, there were just a couple of things we got wrong in the last 15 minutes which meant the game got away from us.”___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
