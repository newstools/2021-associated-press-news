LEXINGTON, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee says 86 Pearson Lane, a startup company that manufactures commercial heat exchangers, will establish its first manufacturing operations in Lexington.According to a news release, 86 Pearson Lane will invest $16 million and create 155 new jobs as it establishes operations. The project is expected to be operational by early 2022 after the company expands a building it recently purchased.“Thank you to 86 Pearson for choosing Henderson County to put down roots and grow their business,” Lee said in a statement. “These new 160 manufacturing jobs will bring new opportunities to Tennesseans in Lexington.”Over the last five years, Tennessee has helped support more than 60 economic development projects in southwest Tennessee. Officials say this support has resulted in 10,000 job commitments and nearly $6.5 billion in capital investment.
