DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) — The Lee Enterprises newspaper chain has adopted a “poison-pill” plan to protect itself from a hostile takeover while the company’s board considers an unsolicited offer from hedge fund Alden Global Capital.The shareholder rights plan would take effect if Alden gets control of more than 10% of Lee’s stock any time in the next year. The Davenport, Iowa-based company said the plan would allow its other shareholders to buy shares at a 50% discount at that point or possibly get free shares for every share they already own.New York-based Alden said last week that it already owed more than 6% of Lee’s stock when it offered to buy the rest of the shares for $24 apiece, or about $141 million. The plan Lee adopted Wednesday would make it more expensive for Alden to acquire a controlling stake in the company.Lee’s Chairman Mary Junck said the so-called “poison-pill” plan will give the board and investors “the time needed to properly assess the acquisition proposal without undue pressure while also safeguarding shareholders’ opportunity to realize the long-term value of their investment in Lee.” ADVERTISEMENTLee owns the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the Buffalo News and dozens of other newspapers including nearly every daily newspaper in Nebraska.
Alden has become one of the largest newspaper owners in the country through a series of acquisitions in recent years, including this year’s purchase of the Tribune papers. Along the way, Alden has developed a reputation for intense cost cuts and layoffs.
