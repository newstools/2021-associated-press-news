He also says that they played the “Aladdin theme song” whenever he would go to pray and snuck pork products in his coffee and turnout gear.The city declined to comment to the News Journal. It said that its law department is reviewing the lawsuit. The department’s racial makeup is overwhelmingly white and male.
