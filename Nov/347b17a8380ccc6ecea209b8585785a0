NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A new exhibit at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans considers how the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was and is remembered. The exhibit is part of the museum’s commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the attack, which took place on December 7, 1941. Japanese planes destroyed or damaged 19 US warships and 300 aircraft in less than 90 minutes, killing more than 2,400 people. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt described it the next day as “a day that will live in infamy.” The exhibit, which opened Tuesday and runs through June 26, is titled “Infamy: Pearl Harbor Remembered.”“This exhibit provides a compelling look at the political climate leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and then focuses on how it was remembered, rather than concentrating on the detailed events of the attack already highlighted in our permanent displays,” said senior curator Tom Czekanski.
