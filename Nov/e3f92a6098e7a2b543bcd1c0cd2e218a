BUENA VISTA TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Authorities were trying to identify the owner of two dogs that attacked an animal control officer in the Saginaw area.The officer was bitten Nov. 5 in a Buena Vista Township neighborhood after a resident reported being nearly attacked by two pit bulls outside his home, according to MLive.com.Two officers were attempting to catch the dogs when the attack occurred.“He was able defend himself from one dog with a catchpole,” Saginaw County Animal Care & Control Director Bonnie Kanicki said of the officer who was attacked. “The other dog managed to bite him on his leg and he fell backward, hitting his head as he kept fending off the dogs with the catchpole.”ADVERTISEMENTBoth officers then used repellant spray to stop and capture the dogs.“This was shocking for our officer,” Kanicki said. “It was pretty traumatic. They’re so good at what they do, but this was a two against one. Even falling backward, he had the wherewithal to continue fighting them off as they attacked him.”The wounded officer was treated at a hospital emergency room and later released.Kanicki said the dogs didn’t have collars, tags or microchips used for identification.“We’re staying hopeful someone will take responsibility for ownership of the dogs, especially since it involved an attack on a human being,” Kanicki said. “We’re hoping someone will have a heart and come forward out of mercy for what these dogs did.”Both dogs remain at an animal control facility.Buena Vista Township is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.
