NEW YORK (AP) — Adele attracted 10.3 million viewers to a busy Sunday night special where she debuted new music, facilitated a marriage proposal and dished with Oprah Winfrey about her divorce and workout routine.The Nielsen company said the CBS show nearly had a bigger audience than April’s Oscars ceremony and, when delayed viewers are eventually figured in, will likely exceed it.Probably the two most popular musicians of the day both had weekend television spotlights to hawk new material. Taylor Swift’s 10-minute performance of her song “All of Me” on “Saturday Night Live” reached 5.8 million viewers, and the clip has already been seen more than 2.5 million times on YouTube.The Academy Awards reached 10.4 million viewers on the night it was televised in April, the audience increasing to 10.7 million adding people who saw it on tape within seven days.Live events generally do poorly in delayed viewing, leading to CBS’ confidence that Adele will eventually pass Oscar. CBS is likely to rerun the musician’s special, too.ADVERTISEMENTSunday was strong for CBS.
