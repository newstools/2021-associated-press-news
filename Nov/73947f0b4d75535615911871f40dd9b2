The state of Vermont is requiring unvaccinated state employees to use personal sick time if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19 through their jobs and have to quarantine. If someone exhausts all their sick time, they could be required to quarantine without being paid. Fully vaccinated employees forced to quarantine will be paid without needing to use sick time. “We want to do whatever we can to take advantage of safe, effective and free vaccines,” Jason Maulucci, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Phil Scott, said Friday. “If there are people who choose not to, there are implications to making that decision.”Maulucci said it was unclear how many people have had to use sick leave or if anyone has gone unpaid yet. Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees Association, said there have been cases in which employees have had to use leave, but didn’t have a specific number. He didn’t know if anyone had gone without pay. ADVERTISEMENTHoward said the union has filed a grievance, saying the new policy was implemented without working through the details with the union. The previous policy allowed state workers who had to quarantine to be paid while out of work.“To the administration’s credit, throughout the pandemic they have not required people who are exposed at work and are ordered to quarantine to use leave balance,” Howard said, calling the change wrong.Workers who choose not to be vaccinated must follow state guidance of regular testing and mask-wearing.Of more than 9,100 state employees, over 8,000 are fully vaccinated, Maulucci said. The administration says vaccination rates in state agencies ranges from a high of 100% at the central office of the Agency of Human Services and the state’s treasurer’s office to rates below 80% at the Vermont Veterans Home, the state military and the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
