PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Gas prices are continuing to rise in northern New England.Prices in Vermont went up the most over the past week, according to GasBuddy, which surveys stations. The price in the state was up 2.3 cents per gallon to $3.39 per gallon, the organization said Monday.GasBuddy’s survey of 1,228 stations in Maine found that prices there rose 2.2 cents per gallon in the past week to $3.38. Prices in New Hampshire went up 1.8 cents per gallon to $3.32.Despite the rising prices, a jump in gas prices that started almost a month ago seems to be abating, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy. He said oil prices have stabilized.However, odds are good that gas prices will stay near today’s high prices going into the holidays, De Haan said.
