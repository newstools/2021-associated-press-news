FARGO, N.D. (AP) — Commissioners in North Dakota’s largest city will be asked Monday to consider ending a wildlife management program that allows bow hunters to kill deer within city limits.Fargo Police Chief Dave Zibloski said a recent study shows that harvest rates are low, the plan is no longer effective and it has created a public safety threat. Zibloski said he will ask the commission to eliminate the program, KFGO radio reported.The program started more than 15 years ago in several city parks along the Red River after complaints over the growing number of deer in the city.Zibolski says he has received petitions containing more than 300 names, both from city and regional residents who support the recommendation to dump the bow hunting program. Zibolski adds that the hunt is time-consuming for the officers who manage it.
