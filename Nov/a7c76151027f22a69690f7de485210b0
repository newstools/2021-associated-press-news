BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A Republican representative is warning the head of the state’s top business lobby not to show up at the Statehouse as lawmakers reconvene Monday to consider COVID-19 legislation.Rep. Chad Christensen in a social media post on Saturday issued the warning to Idaho Association of Commerce & Industry President Alex LaBeau.“Alex, I don’t want to see your face at the Capitol Building,” Christensen wrote in a post that was deleted by Monday morning. “You should stay away. At least stay in the Governor’s office.”Lawmakers are gathering to consider legislation regarding President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 requirements. But some far-right Republican lawmakers, including Christensen, want Idaho lawmakers to ban businesses from requiring vaccines.LaBeau’s group is against government inserting itself between employees and employers. The group also opposes Biden’s requirements that employers with more than 100 employees require workers get vaccinated or frequently tested.ADVERTISEMENTLaBeau declined to comment on Monday.Christensen on Monday denied that his post was a threat or could be interpreted that he was telling an Idaho resident not to come to the Statehouse.“I didn’t tell him not to come, I said I didn’t want to see him here,” Christensen said Monday morning.Christensen, from the eastern Idaho town of Ammon, is known for carrying a sidearm while in the Statehouse, and has mentioned taking a bulletproof vest into his Statehouse office area. He’s in his second two-year term, and the legislation he brings forward typically involves expanding gun rights.Republican Rep. Megan Blanksma, the Republican majority caucus chair, said the Idaho House Republican Caucus had no comment on Christensen’s post as it doesn’t control social media posts.
