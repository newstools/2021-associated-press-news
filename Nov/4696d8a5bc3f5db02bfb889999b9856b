FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets added some depth to the offensive line, acquiring guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif from the Kansas City Chiefs for tight end Daniel Brown ahead of the NFL’s trade deadline Tuesday.Duvernay-Tardif, a licensed medical doctor who opted out of last season to work on the front lines in the battle against COVID-19, was active for the first time Monday night for the Chiefs’ 20-17 win over the New York Giants but didn’t play.The 30-year-old offensive lineman from Quebec, Canada, was a sixth-round pick of the Chiefs in 2014 out of McGill University in Montreal. He has played in 60 NFL games, including 57 starts, and was the starting right guard for Kansas City in its 31-20 victory over San Francisco in the Super Bowl during the 2019 season.Duvernay-Tardif wrote in a Twitter post: “NYC here we come!” He could serve as a backup to starter Greg Van Roten at right guard, or potentially replace him at the position.ADVERTISEMENT“I believe strongly in what they are building,” Duvernay-Tardif said of the Jets, “and I am very thankful to be a part of it.”The O-lineman also thanked the Chiefs organization and fans in his post for their support “throughout my whole career to pursue both medical school and pro football, my two passions.” He added that saying goodbye to Kansas City was a difficult decision.“When I opted out last year, I promised myself to do everything in my power to come back on the field,” Duvernay-Tardif wrote. “Joining the Jets gives me the best opportunity to play.”Brown has spent the past three seasons with the Jets, primarily as a blocking tight end and core special teamer. He has 44 career receptions for 420 yards and two touchdowns in seven NFL seasons. The 29-year-old Brown was signed by Baltimore as an undrafted free agent out of James Madison in 2015 and also played with Chicago before joining the Jets in 2019.___More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
