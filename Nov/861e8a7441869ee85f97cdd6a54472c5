ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia outside linebacker Adam Anderson was released from the Athens-Clarke County jail on $25,000 bond Wednesday, one week after being charged with rape.Anderson’s attorney, Steve Sadow, told The Associated Press Athens-Clarke County Superior Court judge Eric Norris “decided that bond was appropriate and that puts us in position to prove (Anderson’s) innocence.”Sadow said in a statement last week “Adam is innocent of the charge brought against him and intends to vigorously defend himself in court.”During Wednesday’s hearing, a second woman said she was the victim of an alleged 2020 incident involving Anderson in neighboring Oconee County.Anderson remains under indefinite suspension by Georgia. He has missed No. 1 Georgia’s last two games and will not play in Saturday’s game against Charleston Southern.ADVERTISEMENTDespite missing the two games, Anderson still leads Georgia with five sacks.On Monday, Georgia coach Kirby Smart said he has spoken with Anderson but provided no details.““I’m not allowed to talk much about it,” Smart said. “I’ve spoken to Adam, but that’s the extent and all I can talk about.”A 21-year-old woman reported the alleged rape Oct. 29. According to an Athens-Clarke County Police incident report, the woman said she went to an Athens residence on Oct. 29 after having some drinks and woke up on a bed while Anderson was having nonconsensual sexual intercourse with her.___More AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25.
