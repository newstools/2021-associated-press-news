JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Children ages 5 to 11 in Mississippi will begin receiving COVID-19 vaccinations at county health departments on Monday.Earlier this week, U.S. health officials gave the final signoff  to Pfizer’s kid-size COVID-19 shot — doses just a third of the amount given to teens and adults. Mississippi Department of Health officials said appointments will be available for online booking starting after 7 p.m. Friday. Vaccinations for all Mississippians five and older can also be found from other providers including primary care providers, community health centers and pharmacies. The Mississippi State Department of Health has ordered 51,000 doses of vaccine for this age group, officials said. State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers said Friday that Mississippi health officials are pleased the shots for children five and older have been approved, and that they recommend that all eligible children are vaccinated.ADVERTISEMENT“If you have questions or concerns, we urge you to please talk with your pediatrician or healthcare providers,” he said in a press release. Appointments can be made at covidvaccine.umc.edu for all county health departments. Appointments can also be made by calling the COVID-19 hotline at 866-498-4948 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. seven days a week.Around 46% of the total population of Mississippi, a state of 3 million people, is fully vaccinated, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.  Around 10,150 people have died of coronavorus in the state since the pandemic began.
