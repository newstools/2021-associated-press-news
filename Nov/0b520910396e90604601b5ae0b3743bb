Of the 3.3 million new infections reported, 2.1 million came from Europe.It was the seventh consecutive week that COVID-19 cases continued to mount across the 61 countries WHO counts in its European region, which stretches through Russia to central Asia. While about 60% of people in Western Europe are fully immunized against COVID-19, only about half as many are vaccinated in the eastern part of the continent, where officials struggle to overcome widespread vaccine hesitancy.

It noted that deaths jumped by 67% in Norway and by 38% in Slovakia. The health agency previously described Europe as being the epicenter of the ongoing pandemic and warned that there could be 500,000 more deaths by January if urgent actions aren’t taken. In the last week, Austria, the Netherlands and some other countries reintroduced some lockdown measures to try to slow infections, while the U.K. decided to roll out booster doses to everyone over age 40.
