WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation on Thursday reported 99 more confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three additional coronavirus-related deaths.The latest numbers pushed the tribe’s total to 38,616 cases since the pandemic started and 1,518 known deaths.“We need more of our Navajo people to get fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and to get their booster shot prior to the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday,” tribal President Jonathan Nez said in a statement. “In the past, the data has shown that we’ve experienced increases in new infections following major holidays where many families gather.”Nez has urged residents of the vast reservation to be careful when traveling to neighboring cities and states where safety measures aren’t always as strict. The tribe has maintained a mask mandate through most of the pandemic.The reservation covers 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometers) and extends into parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
