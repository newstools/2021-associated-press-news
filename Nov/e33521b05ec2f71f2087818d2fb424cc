LAS VEGAS (AP) — Despite the shouts of protesters, many parents of children between the ages of 5 and 11 have begun getting their kids the COVID-19 vaccine shots in Nevada.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization of the Pfizer vaccine for kids in the 5-11 age group late last month and some Las Vegas pharmacies started giving shots last weekend.Southern Nevada Health District spokeswoman JoAnne Rupiper told the Las Vegas Sun that the district received 21,000 of the lower children’s doses this week and will be able to order more as needed.Health district officials said more than 37,000 children age 17 and under in Clark County have contracted COVID-19 and 269 have been hospitalized.The Sun reported that a couple dozen protesters on the sidewalk outside the clinic tried to drown out health district officials with chants of “Shut it down”as the officials were explaining the vaccine’s safety and efficacy to reporters Wednesday.The protesters also shouted to parents who walked into the clinic that the shots were a form of child abuse.Security guards were between the shot-seekers and the protesters, according to the Sun.
