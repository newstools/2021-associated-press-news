NEW YORK (AP) — Atlanta Braves outfielder Marcell Ozuna received a retroactive 20-game suspension for violating Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy.Ozuna was arrested May 29 on charges of aggravated assault by strangulation and battery after police officers said they witnessed him attacking his wife. He was placed on administrative leave under the domestic violence policy. The suspension is retroactive to Sept. 10 and covers the final 24 days of the regular season, costing him approximately $1.55 million of his $12 million salary.“Having reviewed the totality of the available evidence, I have concluded that Mr. Ozuna violated our policy and that discipline is appropriate,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.Ozuna did not play after May 25 and went on the injured list May 29 with two dislocated fingers on his left hand, missing the Braves’ run to their first World Series title since 1995,ADVERTISEMENT“Any instance of domestic violence is unacceptable, and we fully support the decision by the commissioner’s office regarding Marcell,” the Braves said in a statement. “We are encouraged to know that Marcell has accepted full responsibility for his actions and is taking the necessary measures to learn and grow from the situation.”Ozuna’s agent, Melvin Roman, did not immediately respond to a text seeking comment.Ozuna is entering the second season of a $65 million, four-year contract with the Braves.Fulton County District Attorney’s office spokesman Jeff DiSantis confirmed to The Associated Press on Monday that charges against Ozuna can be dropped if Ozuna completes the conditions of a pretrial diversion program he agreed to on Sept. 9.The conditions include six months of supervision that can be reduced to three months. Ozuna also was ordered to complete a 24-week family violence intervention program, complete at least 200 hours of community service and take an anger management course.Ozuna’s next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 13. ___More AP MLB coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
