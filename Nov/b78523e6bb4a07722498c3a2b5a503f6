MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabamians can now get limited quantities of beer, wine and spirits delivered to their homes after the first companies have gotten licensed.Alabama lawmakers this year approved separate bills to allow alcohol deliveries from retailers to a person’s home and to allow wineries to ship directly to consumers in the state. Several companies have gotten licensed to deliver the alcoholic beverages or to ship wine, according to the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The ABC Licensing Division has several other pending applications for both alcohol delivery and wine shipment, spokesman Daniel Dye wrote in an email. As of Monday, four companies have so far gotten licensed to deliver alcoholic beverages. Those companies are Shipt, Dippi, Pick Up My Things and Deerfoot Spirits. Five companies have gotten licensed to ship wine directly to consumers in Alabama. Those companies are Penrose Hill Winery, James Cole Winery, Winecub, Truth Teller and Robert Young.ADVERTISEMENTAlcohol delivery may not yet be available everywhere as companies ramp up operations.Shipt announced last week that it is doing same-day delivery of beer and wine from Target. The company said it is working to expand delivery from additional retailers.“We’re thrilled to bring alcohol delivery to Shipt’s home state just in time for the holiday season,” Rina Hurst, chief business officer for Shipt, said in a press release.Lawmakers approved the wine shipment bill after years of debate. One year, legislators set up a study commission to research the issues of wine delivery after the measure could not win passage.
