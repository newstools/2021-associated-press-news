PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — All adults in Maine are now eligible for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, Gov. Janet Mills said Wednesday, joining a growing list of states that have done so.Mills, a Democrat, said the change is effective immediately and will apply regardless of underlying medical conditions or other factors. The governor said one of the motivating factors for the change was that health care systems in the state are overburdened by a surge in COVID-19 cases.The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine has risen over the past two weeks from about 467 new cases per day on Nov. 1 to about 564 new cases per day on Monday.The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that all Maine residents live or work in high-risk settings, and that justifies the expansion of booster eligibility, Mills said.“With Maine and other New England states confronting a sustained surge, and with cold weather sending people indoors, we want to simplify the federal government’s complicated eligibility guidelines and make getting a booster shot as straightforward and easy as possible,” Mills said in a statement.Other states that have expanded booster eligibility to all adults include California, Vermont, Colorado, New Mexico, Arkansas and West Virginia.
