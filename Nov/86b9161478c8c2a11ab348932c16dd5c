This year’s top overall draft pick is making his first trip to Indianapolis. While Lawrence has progressed, he’s completed 59.7% of his throws with 774 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions in three road games. This is where he needs to take another big step. ADVERTISEMENTCOLTS PLAYER TO WATCH: Michael Pittman Jr. The second-year receiver has had breakthrough moments this season and has become QB Carson Wentz’s favorite target. He’s caught at least one touchdown pass in three straight games and has five TD receptions in the last five, and when he’s not catching passes, he’s drawing penalties. Against a poorly rated pass defense, expect Wentz to look repeatedly for Pittman.KEY MATCHUP: Indianapolis offensive line vs. Jacksonville pass rush. Last week, DE-OLB Josh Allen made life rough for the Bills quarterback who goes by the same name. He’s emerging as a major defensive disruptor with 18 1/2 sacks in his first 32 games. The Jags need Allen to make a similar impact against a healthier Indianapolis offensive line that has improved steadily throughout this season.KEY INJURIES: Jacksonville had three injured players sit out Wednesday: running back James Robinson (bruised heel), linebacker Myles Jack (knee) and cornerback Chris Claybrooks (concussion). Lawrence (ankle) and left tackle Cam Robinson (back) did limited work. Coach Urban Meyer said he thought Lawrence would play Sunday and the Jags believe both Robinsons will play. ... Four-time Pro Bowl receiver T.Y. Hilton did limited work at practice Wednesday and could clear the concussion protocol by Sunday. Right tackle Braden Smith (elbow) and cornerback Xavier Rhodes (calf) did not practice Wednesday, though coach Frank Reich said he was optimistic Smith would play.

Colts RB Nyheim Hines needs six receptions for No. 200.FANTASY TIP: The Colts’ defense.

Against a young team, a rookie quarterback and in front of a home crowd, Indy’s defense could have a big day.___More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
