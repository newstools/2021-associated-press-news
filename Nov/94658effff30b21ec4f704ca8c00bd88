PECK, Kan. (AP) — A 19-year-old is getting ready to graduate from Washburn University’s School of Law in Topeka. The Hutchinson News reports that Braxton Moral’s parents have long known he was gifted. He skipped fourth grade and then took his first undergraduate class at Harvard University while still in sixth grade. As he got older, he spent his summers at Cambridge. But when the school year started he switched to online classes so he wouldn’t miss out on experiences like prom and homecoming at Ulysses High School.“He just wants to be like everybody else,” his mother, Julie Moral, said. “He’s a blessing from God.”At Harvard, Braxton developed a love for government and realized he wanted to go to law school. But what should have taken three years, he completed in two and one-half. ADVERTISEMENTNext month, Braxton Moral will receive his juris doctor degree. In February, he will take the bar exam.“When I started out, it was more about just something fun to do,” Braxton Moral said. “And then you start off you’re like, ‘Well, I just kind of want to get better now.’ So once you get a little bit of experience, it transfers from just fine to an actual goal.”
