SANDY SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) — Georgia’s fourth-largest school district has granted a contract extension for its superintendent.The Fulton County Board of Education on Tuesday extended Superintendent Mike Looney’s contract through Nov. 9, 2024. He was hired in June 2019 to a three-year deal with a base salary of $329,000, plus monthly allowances for expenses and a vehicle, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.Details of compensation changes as part of the contract extension were not immediately released. President Julia Bernath said attorneys must go over them first.“All that will come out in the details, once legal has a chance to review (it),” she said.Board members praised Looney for guiding the 90,355-student district during the pandemic. Fulton County schools were the first in metro Atlanta to close in March 2020 as COVID-19 struck. Looney was lambasted for requiring masks as classes began in August, sparking a lawsuit by 11 families. When he lifted the rule earlier this month, parents who supported the mask-wearing blasted the reversal.ADVERTISEMENT“I think what you’ve shown is that everybody doesn’t have to agree with every decision but you have to make a decision,” board member Franchesca Warren said. “And you have to have the ability to stand by it and to adjust when you get additional information.”Board member Katha Stuart applauded Looney’s “bold and decisive leadership” while the board touted Looney’s work to invest an estimated $90 million in federal funding on a literacy program aimed at boosting students’ reading skills. The board also praised him for an increase in high school graduation rates.Looney thanked the board for its support.“The reality of it is, I don’t see myself as leading from the front. I see myself as walking with the troops,” he said. “I am absolutely committed and resolute in making sure that all of our students — all of our students — have every opportunity to learn to their maximum potential.”
