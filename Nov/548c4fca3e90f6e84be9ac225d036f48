STOCKHOLM (AP) — Tommy Paul reached his first ATP Tour final by outlasting fellow American Francis Tiafoe at the Stockholm Open on Friday.With a 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-4 win, the 24-year-old Paul followed up his victory over Andy Murray in the quarterfinals in what is proving to be a breakthrough tournament for the former junior French Open champion.“That was the best level I’ve played all year long,” Paul said after his comeback win that took 2 hours, 30 minutes.To claim his first senior title, Paul will have to get past defending champion Denis Shapovalov, who won an all-Canadian semifinal against Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-5 in just under two hours.Shapovalov won the title in Stockholm in 2019 and the 2020 edition was canceled after the coronavirus outbreak.Tiafoe was looking to reach his second final in three tournaments — after the Erste Bank Open in Vienna two weeks ago — by recording a fourth straight win over Paul since their days in the juniors.ADVERTISEMENTPaul finished the match stronger, though, chasing down a drop shot for a winner on his fourth break point to make it 2-1 in the third set and then losing just two of his next 16 service points.“I tried to have fun, and I ended up playing my best tennis,” said Paul, who was born in New Jersey. “The more matches I’ve played, the more comfortable I’ve played in pressure situations. I’ve enjoyed playing in front of the big crowds.”___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
