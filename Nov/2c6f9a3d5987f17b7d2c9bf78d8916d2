WACO, Texas (AP) — Gerry Bohanon threw a touchdown pass and ran for two scores, Baylor’s defense constantly pressured Caleb Williams and Spencer Rattler and the No. 18 Bears beat No. 4 Oklahoma 27-14 on Saturday to end the Sooners’ nation’s-best 17-game winning streak.  Abram Smith had 148 yards rushing, including a 75-yard scamper to set up the first of Bohanon’s two rushing TDs in the fourth quarter, and the Bears (8-2, 5-2 Big 12, CFP No. 13) rebounded from an unexpected loss last week at struggling TCU.The Sooners (9-1, 6-1, CFP No. 8) were held to 260 total yards, their fewest ever for Lincoln Riley in his five seasons as head coach and two seasons as offensive coordinator before that. Baylor fans stormed the field when they thought the game was over, but there had been a timeout, and three seconds remained. Pretty much all of Oklahoma’s team had left the field and it took several minutes to clear the field.ADVERTISEMENTAfter an extended discussion among the referees, and an irate Riley, the defense returned to the field for the final snap. That was a 32-yard field goal by Isaiah Hankins for scoring that could come into play in a Big 12 tiebreaker, and the fans then swarmed the field again. Freshman quarterback Caleb Williams, who had been so dynamic since leading a big comeback against Texas last month, threw two interceptions. Preseason AP All-America Rattler, took over late in the third quarter.NO. 3 ALABAMA 59, NEW MEXICO STATE 3TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Bryce Young passed for 270 yards and five touchdowns, including three to Jameson Williams, and Alabama routed New Mexico State.Young completed 21 of 23 passes in just over a half and the Crimson Tide (9-1, No. 2 CFP) produced the expected romp after a slow start. Alabama even trailed briefly before rattling off seven touchdowns in 20 minutes for a 49-3 halftime lead over the Aggies (1-9).Young became the first Alabama quarterback to complete his first 13 passes in a game, playing only one drive into the second half when he lost a fumble in New Mexico State territory.
