(AP) — The Overland Park Police Department plans to expand its team that responds to calls involving mental health crises, with a goal of diffusing the situations while keeping everyone safe.The new Overland Park Crisis Action Team will have 12 members and six co-responders, though most of the positions haven’t started yet. Currently, it has two crisis intervention specialists and three co-responders, The Kansas City Star reported.When the team responds to a mental health call, it will be accompanied by a clinician from Johnson County Mental Health. A therapy dog will also join the team.  “Our whole goal is to bring them in and let them do their job, and (officers are) there to make sure everybody’s safe,” said police Sgt.
