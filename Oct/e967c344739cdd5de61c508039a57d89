GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) — A lawsuit seeks to get $300 million for taxpayers in a South Carolina county after the county council voted against returning fees scrapped by the state supreme court. The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in June that the Greenville County road and telecommunication fees were actually illegal taxes. The lawsuit filed Wednesday by Jerry A. Bruce of Greer says the county collected about $30 million and contends that taxpayers are due 10 times the unreturned amount, the Greenville News reported.The law cites the June ruling in a separate case filed by three legislators and asks for a jury trial. It notes that the Greenville County Council has voted 7-5 against returning the money.
