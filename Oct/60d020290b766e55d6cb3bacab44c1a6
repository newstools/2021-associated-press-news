The entire touring party had been isolating after five members of the coaching and backroom staff tested positive.Old Trafford can no longer host the match because it clashes with already-planned events at the venue.ADVERTISEMENTThe rescheduling of the test means the white-ball program of matches between the teams, scheduled to start in early July, will be pushed back to later in the month.Coronavirus pandemicRoll up your sleeves: Kids' turn arrives for COVID-19 shotsCOVID-19's global death toll tops 5 million in under 2 yearsEXPLAINER: What to know about vaccines for kids aged 5-11COVID vaccine for younger kids already being packed, shipped“We are very pleased that we have reached an agreement with BCCI to creating a fitting end to what has been a brilliant series so far,” said Tom Harrison, chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board.“We recognize that accommodating this extra match means a tighter schedule for the white-ball series,” Harrison added. “We will continue to manage our players’ welfare and workloads through next year.”___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
