(Knopf via AP)NEW YORK (AP) — Joy Williams’ “Harrow,” a dystopian novel set after an environmental apocalypse, has won the Kirkus Prize for fiction. Williams, who has received numerous honors over the years for her novels and short stories, will receive $50,000. She was praised Thursday by judges for her “unapologetic rebuke to the aspirations of the boomer generation, all the more lacerating for its mordant wit and avoidance of dewy-eyed uplift.” Kirkus, the trade publication, also announced $50,000 prizes for nonfiction, Brian Broome’s memoir “Punch Me Up to the Gods,” and for young reader’s literature, Christina Soontornvat’s “All Thirteen: The Incredible Cave Rescue of the Thai Boys’ Soccer Team.”The Kirkus prizes were established in 2014, with previous winners including Colson Whitehead’s “The Nickel Boys” and Susan Faludi’s “In the Darkroom.”
