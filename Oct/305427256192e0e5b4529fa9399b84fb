SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) — New Zealand will be without Lockie Ferguson for the entire T20 World Cup after the paceman tore a muscle in his right calf in practice, the team said Tuesday.Ferguson felt tightness in his calf in a training session on Monday and an MRI scan revealed a tear that would likely keep him out for three to four weeks.New Zealand coach Gary Stead decided to withdraw Ferguson from the squad because his team is playing five matches in a 13-day span in the Super 12s, starting Tuesday against Pakistan.“It’s a real shame for Lockie to have this happen on the eve of the tournament and the entire team is really feeling for him right now,” Stead said. “He’s a massive part of our T20 side and has been in such good form so to lose him at this time is a blow.”Ferguson is set to be replaced by Adam Milne, who has been training with the squad for the past two weeks after traveling as injury cover. The switch is subject to approval by the ICC technical committee.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
