Cacoulidis and his wife spent the next 20 years developing the island into a family retreat.After his wife died, Cacoulidis put Hope Island on the market for $7.95 million in 2017 because he said his family hadn’t been using the island. Following Cacoulidis’s death in July 2018, the Cacoulidis family decided to take the island off the market.ADVERTISEMENTLifestyleRoll up your sleeves: Kids' turn arrives for COVID-19 shotsGucci's star-studded fashion show shines bright in HollywoodItaly-Croatia fight over Prosecco name gets ready to popHuma Abedin, loyal aide and betrayed wife, picks up the micGeorge Cacoulidis, Cacoulidis’ son, said they wanted to keep the island in the family but struggled to maintain the private island and property.
