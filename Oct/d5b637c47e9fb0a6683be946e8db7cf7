MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department is encouraging hunters who take part in the state’s annual youth and novice deer hunt next weekend to bring any deer they take to one of the state’s 19 biological reporting stations. That helps state wildlife biologists gather data on the health of Vermont’s deer population, the department said. “Examining deer during this weekend is our best opportunity to assess the deer herd because hunters are allowed to harvest any deer, including spike bucks,” said Vermont Fish and Wildlife’s deer project leader Nick Fortin in a written statement. “Biologists will be able to collect data on age, weight and antler development to help guide future deer management decisions.” Hunters are required to report deer in person at a big game reporting station during the youth and novice deer weekend on Oct. 23 and 24. ADVERTISEMENTResident or nonresident hunters age 15 and younger who have completed a hunter education course must buy a hunting license and get a free youth weekend deer tag, the department said. Hunters age 16 and older who have completed a hunter education and purchased their first hunting license within the last 12 months before the weekend must get a novice weekend deer tag. Both young and novice hunters must be accompanied by an unarmed adult over 18 who has Vermont hunting license. The youth and novice hunters may take one deer of either sex on the weekend.
