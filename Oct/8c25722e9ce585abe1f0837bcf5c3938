HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut’s unemployment rate continued to drop in September as state employers added back jobs for the ninth consecutive month. The state Department of Labor reported Thursday that unemployment was 6.8% in September, down from 7.2% in August and 8.3% in September of 2020. Employers added an estimated 4,700 jobs to the economy last month, according to the report. Patrick Flaherty, the director of the department’s Office of Research, said the state has now regained just over 70% of jobs that were lost as a result of the pandemic lockdown in March and April of 2020.“Construction has now regained all of the jobs lost during the pandemic,” he said. “We are going in the right direction and anticipate continued progress.”Food services, retail and professional services have recovered 75% of jobs lost, according to the report. Labor Commissioner Dante Bartolomeo said weekly filings for unemployment compensation, which rose to above 400,000 at the peak of the pandemic, have dropped to about 52,000.“There are thousands of good paying jobs with benefits out there and employers are hiring quickly — in some cases on site at job fairs and other event,” she said. “It’s a great time for workers to strengthen their skills, get into the market, and even start a whole new career.”
