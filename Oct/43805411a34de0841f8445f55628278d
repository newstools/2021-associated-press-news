OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma conducted 112 executions from 1976 to October 2015, when the state imposed a moratorium following three consecutive flawed executions or attempted executions. That number rose to 113 Thursday when Oklahoma put John Marion Grant to death by lethal injection, the state’s first execution in more than six years.A timeline of key events involving the moratorium and steps Oklahoma took to resume lethal injections:— April 29, 2014: Clayton Lockett writhes and groans on the gurney as Oklahoma uses the surgical sedative midazolam for the first time during an execution. Then-state prisons director Robert Patton halts the execution process, but Lockett dies 43 minutes later. A second execution set that night, for Charles Warner, is postponed. The state later says an improperly placed intravenous line — not the new drug mix — caused problems.
