PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona on Wednesday reported nearly 6,300 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases, an usually high number that state officials said included some results previously delayed by a date-processing problem.Because of the since-resolved problem that the Department of Health Services said occurred over the weekend, the state reported only 158 additional cases on Monday and 450 on Tuesday. Numbers of deaths reported both of those days also were lower than usual.The additional 6,299 cases and 81 more deaths reported Wednesday increased the state’s pandemic totals to 1,156,731 cases and 21,044 deaths. On most days this month, the state has reported at least 2,000 additional cases.In announcing the data-processing problem, the Department of Health Services said Monday that results that day and Tuesday would be unusually low and that results reported Wednesday and Thursday would be unusually high once delayed results were included.As of Tuesday, 1,730 COVID-19 patients occupied inpatient hospital beds, according to the dashboard.
