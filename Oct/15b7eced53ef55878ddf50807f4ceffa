Hopefully I can play, tomorrow, also a great match.”Sinner, who has yet to drop a set in the tournament, is chasing Hubert Hurkacz for the eighth and final spot in the ATP Finals. He also trails Cameron Norrie.“It’s a long way,” Sinner said of trying to qualify for the season-ending competition in Turin beginning Nov. 14. “There’s still this tournament and hopefully three to go. There are other players, incredible players, everyone is trying to do that. Obviously it’s in my mind and hopefully this year. If not, I can be happy about my season (that) I played.”Brooksby, who did not play in 2020 due to a toe injury, was aiming for his second final of the year after Newport.Schwartzman is 5-1 against Americans this season.___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
