LAS VEGAS (AP) — A state court judge has ordered the city of Las Vegas to pay about $34 million to a developer who has tried for years to build homes on a vacant former golf course in northwest Las Vegas.Clark County District Court Judge Timothy Williams previously found the city liable for blocking development of the former Badlands Golf Club course by 180 Land Co. LLC, a company belonging to developer EHB Cos.The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Friday the city could be on the hook for much more. The civil judgment involves a nearly 35-acre (14-hectare) parcel, in just one of four lawsuits related to large slices of the disputed 250 acres (101 hectares) including the golf course. It does not count attorney fees.ADVERTISEMENTSimilar lawsuits are pending before different judges over developers’ plans for parcels totaling 133 acres (54 hectares), 65 acres (26 hectares) and 17 acres (7 hectares).EHB sought to build homes after buying the property in 2015 south of the Summerlin Parkway near the upscale Queensridge neighborhood.Almost all development plans stalled at City Hall in disputes about whether zoning rules prohibit housing and allow only open-space projects. Lawsuits were filed in 2017 and 2018.City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman represents the district where the property is located. She ran a special election campaign in 2019 that largely centered on her vow to settle the dispute to protect taxpayers.Seaman told the Review-Journal on Friday that continued litigation is wasting taxpayer money and that the city should reach an agreement with the developer.The City Council voted this month to appeal Williams’ ruling. City officials declined to comment about the judgment, citing a practice of not speaking publicly about litigation.
