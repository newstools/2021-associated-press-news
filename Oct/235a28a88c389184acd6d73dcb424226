Susan Collins said spending bills currently being considered in Congress contain more than $260 million for 106 Maine projects.The Maine Republican said the funding is included in the fiscal 2022 bills approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, which she serves on. The bills still must be voted upon by the full Senate and House.“I heard from local officials about how these projects will enhance the well-being of Mainers and improve the delivery of town services from Aroostook County to York County,” she said.All told, there were nine fiscal 2022 appropriations bills, the last of which were released last week. Three were already awaiting votes.The projects range from $2.5 million to renovate and expand a public safety building in Auburn to $3 million to demolish structures and improve roads at the former Loring Air Force Base to $100,000 for planning a dredging project at Isle au Haut.
