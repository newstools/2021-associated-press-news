He came through on Saturday in Game 2, pitching 5 1/3 innings for the win, but he faltered out of the bullpen in Game 4 on Tuesday and allowed four runs while retiring just two batters.“I don’t think there’s any limitations,” he said. “My arm feels good, and mentally I’m going to be ready and prepared for this game.”ADVERTISEMENTPRODUCING PUJOLSAlbert Pujols is doing his part to extend the season for the Dodgers.The 41-year-old slugger had two hits and scored two runs as Los Angeles, boosted by Chris Taylor’s three home runs, routed Atlanta 11-2 Thursday night, cutting the Braves’ lead in the NL Championship Series to 3-2.MLBDurant scores 32, Nets hit 22 3s in 117-108 win over HawksReds trade veteran C Tucker Barnhart to Tigers for prospectPhillies decline club options on Herrera, McCutchenWorld Series TV viewers up 20% from 2020 but down from 2019Signed by the Dodgers in mid-May after being released by the Angels, Pujols is 5 for 15 in eight games this postseason.
