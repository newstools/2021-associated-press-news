For those who oppose Thursday night NFL games, be it players, coaches, fans or bettors, this week is a perfect example of why.It’s difficult enough to prepare for a Sunday game when you have key injuries, particularly at quarterback. And when both teams are uncertain about their quarterback situation, well, it doesn’t make for the best brand of football in a short week. As for Pro Picks, it would be best to avoid making a choice for Denver, ranked 20th in the AP Pro32, at No. 13 Cleveland. The Broncos were a 3 1/2-point underdog, according to FanDuel SportsBook, before the Browns scratched Baker Mayfield because of his left shoulder injury. Case Keenum gets the start and the line dropped to 2 points with that news.“Case Keenum will be our starter tomorrow night and we have full confidence in him to lead us and do the things necessary to put us in position to win,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Wednesday. “Baker fought really hard to play, he’s a competitor and obviously wants to be out there, but just couldn’t make it on a short week.”ADVERTISEMENTDenver, on the other hand, believes starting QB Teddy Bridgewater’s sore foot won’t sideline him. Drew Lock, who lost the job to the veteran Bridgewater in training camp, is the backup.NFLNo. 5 Spartans try to keep unbeaten quest on track at PurdueBoth coming off tough losses, Browns and Bengals clash  Chiefs hoping Ingram can provide spark to sluggish pass rushPatriots will look to run the ball with Harris vs. PanthersVon Miller, the Broncos’ star linebacker, virtually assured his team will break a three-game slide.
