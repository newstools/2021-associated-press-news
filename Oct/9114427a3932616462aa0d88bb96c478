The University of Maine System will mail out letters this week informing more than 200 students they’re being withdrawn from classes for failure to get vaccinated or to agree to tests.The students missed the Friday deadline for confirming vaccination status or requesting an exemption, but it appears that about half of them are no longer active students, UMS spokesperson Dan Demeritt said Monday.The university is still willing to work with the remaining 100 or so students to resolve their situation, he said. “We don’t want anyone to stop going to school but it’s critical that we have full engagement with our vaccination and testing policy to keep everyone safe,” Demeritt said.The Bangor Daily News reported that 221 students missed the Friday deadline and will receive disenrollment letters and be withdrawn from all in-person classes without a refund.That represents less than 1% of the University of Maine System’s 26,111 students at seven campuses and affiliates. Some students, however, are fully remote and exempt from the vaccination requirement.
