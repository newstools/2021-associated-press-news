MAPLEWOOD, Mo. (AP) — A St. Louis County councilwoman has accused a Lyft driver of pulling a gun on her husband when he asked the driver to wear a mask, and police are now investigating. Councilwoman Lisa Clancy made the allegation in a tweet Monday directed at Lyft saying, “one of your drivers just cocked a gun on my husband when he asked him to wear a mask (which is your policy).”Clancy said her husband was on his way to the airport in St. Louis early Monday morning and missed his flight to New York City because the driver canceled the trip. The incident was reported to police, but Clancy said that she and her husband were unable to provide police with the driver’s name or other information because the driver erased records of the transaction in the Lyft phone app when he canceled the trip, the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.Coronavirus pandemicRoll up your sleeves: Kids' turn arrives for COVID-19 shotsCOVID-19's global death toll tops 5 million in under 2 yearsEXPLAINER: What to know about vaccines for kids aged 5-11COVID vaccine for younger kids already being packed, shippedADVERTISEMENTMaplewood Police Acting Chief Lt.
