PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — More than 75% of Maine’s eligible population is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and the pace of daily vaccination is accelerating.About 70% of the entire population is fully vaccinated, state data said Wednesday. That figure includes residents too young to get shots. Vaccinations for children younger than 12 are expected to potentially become available early in November.There is still some geographic disparity in the state’s vaccination rates. Nearly 90% of eligible people are vaccinated in Cumberland County, but the rate is as low as 64% in more rural counties such as Piscataquis and Somerset, state records said. However, the state has one of the highest rates in the country as a whole.The state has also increased its daily vaccination rate by 33% over the past week, said Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. About 35% of daily vaccines administered in Maine are boosters, he said.“Primary series shots remain our focus,” Shah said. “It’s great to see more and more people getting vaccinated all throughout the state.”The increase in vaccinations has come as the daily caseload of COVID-19 has decreased somewhat. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine decreased over the past two weeks, going from about 517 on Oct. 11 to about 463 on Oct. 25.The AP is using data collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering to measure outbreak caseloads and deaths across the United States.There have been more than 102,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,154 deaths from the virus in the state since the start of the pandemic.
