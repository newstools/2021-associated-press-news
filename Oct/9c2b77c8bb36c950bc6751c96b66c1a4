(AP) — A 43-year-old Connecticut inmate died Friday from COVID-19-related complications, the Department of Correction announced Saturday.It marked the state’s 21st COVID-related inmate death since the pandemic began about 18 months ago, according to Karen Martucci, a DOC spokesperson. The man’s name was not released, due to medical privacy laws.The inmate, who had underlying health issues, had been receiving medical care at a local hospital since Oct. 4. The prison department said the man died after refusing to be intubated last week.There continues to be a mask mandate for both inmates in staff at Connecticut’s prisons.
