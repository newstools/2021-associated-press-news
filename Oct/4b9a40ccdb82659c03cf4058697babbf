UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Thirty top business leaders are seeking to encourage private investment to help the U.N. achieve development goals for 2030, including tackling climate change, preserving the environment, ending poverty, promoting economic growth, and improving health care and education.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who launched the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance two years ago, said at a virtual meeting Tuesday that he is counting on the group “to catalyze greater investment for developing countries and make net-zero (carbon emissions) and sustainability the core of everyone’s policies and business models.”Since its inception, the alliance of business leaders says, it has worked with the U.N. and other partners to develop standards, tools and products to draw long-term investment into sustainable development.The U.N.’s chief economist, Elliott Harris, said at a news conference after Tuesday’s virtual meeting that there has long been a perception that traditional investments “will generate more of a financial return than a sustainable investment.”ADVERTISEMENT“Increasingly, that is no longer true,” he argued. “Sustainable investments do generate very healthy financial returns and have the advantage of the longer-term contribution to enhance greater sustainability.”ClimateCountries pledge to cut heavily polluting coal, with caveatsIs it green, or forever toxic?

It has also issued more than 60 recommendations for scaling up investment in the goals.Alliance co-chair Oliver Bate, CEO of Germany’s Allianz SE, said that with the upcoming launch of a net-zero climate exchange-traded fund and a blended finance fund to invest in sustainable infrastructure “we are moving towards creating real life opportunities to finance” the U.N. goals.The business leaders in the alliance come from about 24 countries around the world and include corporations, big institutional investors, stock exchanges and commercial banks, and technology, energy and manufacturing. Among them are the CEOs of Citigroup and Bank of America in the U.S., UBS Group in Switzerland, Aware Super in Australia, CIMB in Malaysia, Infosys in India and Pal Pensions in Nigeria as well as the chairs of the Agricultural Bank of China, Emirates Environmental Group and SulAmerica in Brazil, and the presidents of the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan and Mexico’s Consejo Mexicano de Negocios.
