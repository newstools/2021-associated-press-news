LOS LUNAS, N.M. (AP) — Facebook is expanding its Los Lunas data center by two new buildings, according to company officials. Once completed, company officials said the nearly 3.8 million-square-foot data center will represent an investment of nearly $2 billion and will support more than 400 operational jobs. “The expansion proves New Mexico can meet the needs of large global companies which need a skilled workforce, modern infrastructure, and a strong and competitive business environment,” Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement Wednesday.Facebook also announced a new goal to restore 200% of the water that the data center consumes into New Mexico watersheds. The company has invested in five local water restoration projects to date.
