Buffalo is back on top of the Mid-American Conference sacks chart after its school-record performance against Akron.The Bulls have been the MAC’s leading sack team the past two years, but had slipped a bit this season under a new coaching staff and were fifth entering their game at Akron on Saturday.
Buffalo sacked DJ Irons 10 times and Zach Gibson once. The Bulls’ 11 sacks were the most by a Football Bowl Subdivision team since Miami (Ohio) recorded 12 against Akron in 2019.Kyler Laing had 3.5 sacks, the most by a Buffalo player since the program moved to the FBS in 1999.Buffalo, which had a total of 12 sacks over its previous six games, moved from 41st to seventh nationally in sacks, and from fifth to first in the MAC.Akron has been an easy mark for defenses looking to build up their sack numbers. The Zips have allowed 202 in their last 52 games, and they’ve allowed six or more in 12 games since 2017.College footballNo. 24 Cajuns aim to validate ranking vs. Georgia StatePac-12 division races taking shape headed into final monthCollege Picks: Upset alerts for Michigan State, OregonNo dominant ACC team equals nailbiters all aroundADVERTISEMENTTHE 200 CLUBChris Smith of Louisiana and Chase Brown of Illinois turned in the only 200-yard rushing performances.Smith ran 24 times for 238 yards against Arkansas State on Thursday, and Brown had 33 carries for 223 yards against Penn State.
