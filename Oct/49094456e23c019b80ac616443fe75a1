MEXICO CITY (AP) — A compact Hurricane Rick roared ashore along Mexico’s southern Pacific coast early Monday with 105 mph (165 kph) winds and heavy rain amid warnings of potential flash floods in the coastal mountains.The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Rick made landfall as a Category 2 storm about 15 miles (25 kilometers) east of the port of Lazaro Cardenas around 5 a.m. Later Monday, Rick weakened to a tropical depression and was 140 miles (225 kilometers) north of Lazaro Cardenas, moving north at 14 mph (22 kph).Forecasters said heavy rains meant the threat of flooding continued. The storm’s maximum sustained winds had decreased to 35 mph (55 kph). The center warned that Rick could produce flash floods and mudslides in the mountainous terrain on the coast.“During its passage over land, it will cause intense to torrential rains and possible mudslides and flooding, as well as rising levels in streams and rivers, in the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco,” Mexico’s National Water Commission said in a statement.ADVERTISEMENTFloodsUS agency decides against flooding Grand Canyon amid drought'Ordinary people suffer most': China farms face climate woesParts of Maine cope with flooding after weekend stormsDeadline extended for flood claim proof for Hurricane IdaAuthorities in Lazaro Cardenas had opened six emergency shelters for people who might want to leave low-lying areas.
