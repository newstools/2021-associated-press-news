LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky reported another 49 deaths from COVID-19 on Friday, a day after the state’s governor urged residents to get a booster shot in efforts to defeat the coronavirus.Among the reported deaths was a 31-year-old person, Gov. Andy Beshear said on his Twitter account. The state reported 767 new confirmed cases of the virus and another 846 probable new cases, for a total of 1,623. Beshear also said that the testing positivity rate has decreased to 5.08%.At a Thursday news conference, Beshear said getting a COVID-19 booster will play a crucial role in ultimately defeating the coronavirus.People ages 65 and older should get a booster, he said. Also eligible are people living in long-term settings, those with underlying health conditions and those exposed to a lot of other people through work, the governor said. It also applies to recipients of the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, with a booster recommended for them at least two months after the vaccination.ADVERTISEMENT“Boosters are now the most critical thing, aside from getting more people vaccinated,” the Democratic governor said.Meanwhile, Kentucky’s favorable trends have continued in the fight against the virus, with declining COVID-19 hospitalizations, admissions to intensive care units and ventilator use, he said.
