MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — Vermont’s unemployment rate dropped a tenth of a percentage point to 2.9% in September, the state Labor Department said Friday. The national rate last month was 4.8%, a drop of four-tenths of a percentage point August. Around Vermont, the unemployment rate ranged from 1.4% in White River Junction to 3.1% in Bennington. Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington called the state’s economic recovery unusual for many reasons. “While the unemployment rate is near pre-pandemic levels, the labor force is down approximately 7% or 25,000 individuals. The number of filled jobs is down about 6% or 20,000 positions,” said Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington. “This contraction in the labor force combined with Vermont employers ramping up hiring efforts to fill open positions is resulting in an extremely tight labor market.”
