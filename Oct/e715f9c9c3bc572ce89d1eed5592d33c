LISLE, Ill. (AP) — Leaders at the Morton Arboretum plan a national search for the museum’s next president. The Daily Herald reports that trustees hired a recruiting firm to lead the search for President and CEO Gerard Donnelly’s successor. Donnelly plans to retire in September 2022 after celebrating the arboretum’s centennial anniversary. Donnelly has led the arboretum, which includes more than 1,700 tree-filled acres in Lisle, since 1990. He’s been credited with boosting the museum’s fundraising program and developing new projects, including a visitors center, a children’s garden and the Center for Tree Science. “Gerry loves what he does, and it shows,” said board chairman Stephen Van Arsdell. “By describing his vision, Gerry helps others to see through his eyes. And this allows people to see the value of the arboretum, to understand that they can contribute to building a better world by planting and protecting trees.”
