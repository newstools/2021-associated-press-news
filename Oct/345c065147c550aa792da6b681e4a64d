BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Enrollment declines at North Dakota’s institutions of higher learning haven’t been as steep as elsewhere since the COVID-19 pandemic began. According to a new report from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, enrollment across the country at colleges and universities is down 6.5% compared to two years ago, which is the largest two-year enrollment drop in the last 50 years.North Dakota’s numbers haven’t been quite so steep, and in the case of some universities, including Dickinson State University, enrollment has increased,  KFYR-TV reported. “Students that are interested or deciding to go college, that number is kind of going down. But we, in this specific area of the country, don’t have that quite as much as other areas. So we still have a pretty good pool of students that are graduating and going to college,” said Stephanie Osborne, DSU admissions director.ADVERTISEMENTOverall North Dakota colleges and universities experienced a 3.4% decrease in enrollment from 2019, and a 1.4% decrease from 2020.Other schools that have actually had enrollment increases since 2019 include Dakota College at Bottineau, Valley City State University and the University of North Dakota.
