HONOLULU (AP) — The mayor of Honolulu says Oahu will drop capacity restrictions on large managed events beginning next week. Starting Wednesday, fully vaccinated people can gather in large numbers for weddings, concerts, sport games and other regulated events. “We go forward carefully,” Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said. “We go forward with love in our hearts and concern for our public, but we go forward.” Blangiardi stressed that everyone must comply with vaccine requirements. The “Safe Access Oahu” vaccination program, which has been in place for restaurants, bars, theaters and other managed events since mid-September, will continue to be required for large gatherings. The policy requires that people show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test that was taken within 72 hours of the event.The rules do not apply to children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated. Masks are still required in most settings. ADVERTISEMENTHawaii has had among the lowest infection, hospitalization and death rates in the nation throughout the pandemic though the islands experienced a large surge of delta variant cases that filled hospitals in recent months. Healthcare Association of Hawaii President Hilton Raethel said the policy change rewards residents. “We have so much to be proud of here in Hawaii,” Raethel said.
