Grrrrrr!!!!That’s the sound of gritting teeth throughout the NFL as what should be one of the best prime-time matchups of the season loses some of its luster. Green Bay’s star receiver Davante Adams and fellow wideout Allen Lazard tested positive for COVID-19 this week. So when the 6-1 Packers, winners of six in a row, visit the Cardinals, at 7-0 the league’s only unbeaten team, it might not be the headline event it would have warranted with a full team coming to Arizona.Somehow, the Packers are 6-0 without Adams in the lineup. Go figure.“We’re not a better team without him, that’s for sure,” Aaron Rodgers said. “I’d have to look at each of those games, but we’ve just found a way to win those games.”Can they find a way to win this one against perhaps the most balanced team in the NFL?“We understand that we’ve got a tough opponent that we’re going up against, and obviously we’d love to be at full power and have everybody out there,” said fellow receiver Randall Cobb, whose role certainly should increase. “His presence will be missed, but it’s important for us to go out and to find a way to win a ballgame.”Coronavirus pandemicCOVID-19 vaccine campaign expands to elementary-age childrenCOVID-19's global death toll tops 5 million in under 2 yearsEXPLAINER: What to know about vaccines for kids aged 5-11COVID vaccine for younger kids already being packed, shippedADVERTISEMENTGreen Bay, ranked fourth in the AP Pro32, is a 6 1-2 point underdog at top-ranked Arizona, according to FanDuel SportsBook.
