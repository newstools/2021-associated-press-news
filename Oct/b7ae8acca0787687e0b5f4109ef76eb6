Florida (4-3, 2-3 SEC) vs. No. 1 Georgia (7-0, 5-0) in Jacksonville, Florida, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. EDT (CBS).Line: Georgia by 14 ½, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.Series record: Debatable. Georgia counts a 52-0 victory in 1904 and says it leads 53-44-2. Florida insists it didn’t compete at the varsity level until 1906 and calls it 52-44-2.WHAT’S AT STAKE?Georgia has won 11 in a row since getting steamrolled last year in the rivalry game known as “The World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party.” The Gators racked up 571 yards – the most in Bulldogs coach Kirby Smart’s tenure – against a defense that played without massive nose tackle Jordan Davis and two others. Georgia looks to avenge that loss and move a step closer to winning the SEC’s Eastern Division for the fourth time in five years.ADVERTISEMENTKEY MATCHUPGeorgia’s dominant defense against one of the nation’s top rushing attacks. The Bulldogs lead the country in total defense, giving up just 208.4 yards a game. The Gators are averaging a nation-leading 6.33 yards a carry, with much of that coming from quarterbacks Emory Jones and Anthony Richardson.PLAYERS TO WATCHFlorida: Jones is expected to start again, but no one would be surprised to see Richardson on the field for the second series and end up playing more snaps. Richardson is bigger, faster and more dynamic than Jones, who was benched in a 49-42 loss at LSU on Oct. 16.Georgia: Freshman TE Brock Bowers could be the toughest matchup for the Gators. Bowers has 25 receptions for 416 yards and six touchdowns. He caught five passes for 101 yards and two scores in his last game, a 30-13 win against Kentucky.FACTS & FIGURESLike Florida, Georgia hasn’t announced its plans at quarterback.

The only upset came in 1985 when 17th-ranked Georgia upended No. 1 Florida 24-3. … Georgia’s Smart is 3-1 in head-to-head matchups against Florida coach Dan Mullen. … Georgia is a double-digit favorite in the rivalry for the third time since 1990. ...
