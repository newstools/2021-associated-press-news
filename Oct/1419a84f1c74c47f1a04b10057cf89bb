WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation on Thursday reported 97 more COVID-19 cases, but no deaths for the 19th time in the past 29 days.The tribe had reported 119 additional cases on Wednesday along with nine coronavirus-related deaths.The latest numbers pushed the tribe’s totals to 36,508 confirmed COVID-19 cases from the virus since the pandemic began more than a year ago.The known death toll remains at 1,484.Based on cases from Oct. 8-21, the Navajo Department of Health issued an advisory notice for 48 communities due to uncontrolled spread of COVID-19.“Unfortunately, in-person family and social gatherings are leading to more cases of COVID-19 on the Navajo Nation,” tribal President Jonathan Nez said. “In addition, residents who travel to cities off our Nation and let their guard down often bring back the virus to their households. We have to do better and we have to remind our loved ones to take precautions and wear a mask in public whether they are on or off the Navajo Nation.”The tribe’s reservation is the country’s largest at 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometers) and covers parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
