SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Officials with the state Health and Human Services departments are awaiting federal approval to tap into a temporary funding stream to help end a 13-year wait faced by New Mexico families seeking services under a developmental disabilities program.The officials told a panel of lawmakers this week about their plan to move about 4,100 people off the waiting list and into services in the next two years.State funding of about $75 million a year would be needed eventually, the  Albuquerque Journal reported.Dr. David Scrase, who also leads the Health and Human Services departments, called it a rare opportunity of alignment between federal funding and a critical state goal.“We have made progress over the last two years getting more than 700 people the services they need,” Scrase said in a statement. “These dollars will allow us to provide services for thousands more.”ADVERTISEMENTLong waits have plagued the state Developmental Disabilities Waiver program for years. In the Albuquerque area, those being removed from the waiting list have typically been watching since 2008 for the funding to become available.Participants can receive therapy, help with employment and other services aimed at allowing them to be active members of the community. It’s called a waiver program because the federal government has waived the requirement to use a nursing home or other institutional setting to provide the services.Under the plan outlined outlined during a meeting of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee, the state would rely on federal funding at first to pay for services for every individual on the waiting list. Then state funding would be used starting in about four years to maintain the program.“We believe we have a blueprint to move our state forward and tackle this problem,” said Jason Cornwell, director of the Developmental Disabilities Supports Division of the Department of Health.New Mexico is seeking approval from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to use funding available for home- and community-based services.Robert Kegel, whose son receives waiver services, testified that legislators should take immediate action on a variety of fronts to improve the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities.“We’ve denied people the care they’re absolutely entitled to,” he said.Senate Majority Whip Linda Lopez, D-Albuquerque, said New Mexico’s strong financial position makes it an appropriate time to end the waiting list.Strong revenue growth is projected for the coming year, and federal coronavirus relief funds have flooded the state.“We have to figure out a plan — a plan that really works,” Lopez said.
