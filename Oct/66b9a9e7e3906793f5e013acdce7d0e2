LOS ANGELES (AP) — At first glance, broadcast newcomers “Ghosts” and “The Wonder Years” have barely had a chance to prove themselves in the ratings.The CBS comedy “Ghosts” has shown early promise, so far landing just outside the top 20 for the young season so far, while ABC’s reboot of “The Wonder Years” sitcom is hovering at around No. 65, according to Nielsen figures.But the two have already been granted full-season runs. Admiring reviews for both aside, the reason lies in the numbers — the ones that measure how a show performs in the long run, not just after its first day of airing as reflected above.The debut episode of “The Wonder Years” was watched by 3.2 million viewers on ABC when it aired Sept. 22. That figure grew to 6.4 million after a week of combined broadcast and digital viewership.“Ghosts,” based on a hit BBC comedy, drew just shy of 5.6 million viewers to its Oct. 7 broadcast debut, reaching 7.76 million after seven days that also included on-demand viewing.NFLState appeals court: Rams lawsuit will stay in St. LouisTuesday Sports in BriefColumn: A most improbable team brings Atlanta a titleBackup QBs shine across NFL in Week 8ADVERTISEMENT“We are gratified that audiences have taken to ‘Ghosts’ so quickly and are incredibly proud of this unique and imaginative show,” CBS Entertainment President Kelly Kahl told The Associated Press shortly after the series bowed.
