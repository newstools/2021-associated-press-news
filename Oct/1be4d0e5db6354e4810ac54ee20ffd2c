MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) — Wildlife managers intentionally killed a grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park they said had become a safety risk after it got used to getting food from humans.Last fall, the grizzly got food at a home south of the park. This fall, the bear got food from humans again, and caused property damage, on private land near the park, park officials said in a statement Tuesday.The bear fed on chicken feed and garbage numerous times in September and October. Then it became bolder and managed to break into a bear-resistant dumpster in the park.Park officials working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Wyoming Game and Fish Department captured and killed the bear Saturday.Grizzlies in the Yellowstone region, which includes Grand Teton and other areas surrounding Yellowstone National Park, have rebounded from about 100 in the 1970s to around 700 today. They remain federally protected as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act.Wyoming officials seek to have grizzlies removed from such protection in the state.
