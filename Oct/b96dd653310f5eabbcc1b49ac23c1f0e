SUFFOLK, Va. (AP) — An investigation found that a Virginia fifth-grader who died of coronavirus complications last month did not escort sick classmates to the nurse, according to school administrators.Suffolk Public Schools officials investigated whether 10-year-old Teresa Sperry had been walking with sick classmates, against the staff’s COVID-19 protocol, after her parents said she was picked for the classroom job a week before she died, The Virginian-Pilot reported.The Hillpoint Elementary School student died Sept. 27 at a Norfolk hospital. Her symptoms began five days earlier with a headache, but escalated quickly, her parents said. The nurse recalled Teresa walking with a student who hurt his ankle on the playground, but not for children with cold symptoms, schools spokeswoman Anthonette Ward said.ADVERTISEMENT“Our staff did adhere to the protocol,” Ward said. “If a student is sick, an administrator comes and walks them down. That part was upheld.”Jeff and Nicole Sperry, questioned how thoroughly school officials looked into it. It’s unclear where the 10-year-old was exposed to the virus. Virginia Department of Health spokeswoman Brookie Crawford declined to confirm that a contact-tracing investigation was conducted or if the agency knew where Teresa was exposed, citing privacy reasons.
