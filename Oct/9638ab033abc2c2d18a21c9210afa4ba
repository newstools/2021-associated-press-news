TOPSHAM, Maine (AP) — Maine Gov. Janet Mills received her COVID-19 booster on Thursday, and urged others to follow her lead.Mills, 73, received her shot at a pharmacy in a Target store in Topsham.“I encourage all eligible Maine people to take advantage of these widely available and effective vaccines today, whether you are getting your first shot or your third shot. It could save your life or someone else’s,” she said.All Mainers 65 and older qualify for a booster along with all 18 and older who live in long-term care settings, have underlying medical conditions or live and work in a high-risk setting.The governor received two rounds of Moderna vaccine last winter, and her booster dose was also from Moderna. Still, health officials have said it’s OK to mix and match initial shots and boosters.___This story has been corrected to show that the governor’s initial two-dose course of the COVID-19 vaccine was from Moderna, not Pfizer.
