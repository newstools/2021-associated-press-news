Shapira. “Given the long-standing and positive working relationship Heaven Hill has with its employees, it is disappointing we were unable to reach an agreement with union leadership.”Local union President Matt Aubrey condemned the company’s latest move.“It is stunning that Heaven Hill is refusing to continue negotiations and is resorting to hiring non-union workers to try to push out the hardworking Kentucky men and women who have worked at the company for generations and made it the success it is today,” he said in a statement.He said the union is willing to meet with company negotiators to continue talks.Aubrey accused the company of refusing to bargain in good faith, and said the union had filed Unfair Labor Practices charges against Heaven Hill with the National Labor Relations Board.The company said its operations have continued with “limited interruptions” during the strike due to a “successful contingency plan.”Workers often spend long careers at Kentucky bourbon distilleries, and the jobs often attract multiple generations of families.
