DODGE CITY, Kan. (AP) — Five family members in southwestern Kansas are fighting for their lives after being sickened by carbon monoxide, Dodge City police said.Police were called Monday to a home in Dodge City, where they encountered thick vehicle exhaust and found five men unconscious and critically ill. All five were quickly removed and taken to hospitals, where they remained Tuesday in critical condition, police said.Investigators believe the poisoning was an accident caused when one of the men left a vehicle running in the home’s closed garage, allowing fumes to fill the home. Police said in a social media post that officers were alerted to the poisoning by a family friend who went to the house. “One subject was on the phone with his mother in Guatemala when he passed out,” the post read. “His mother tried for over two hours to get help from friends in Dodge City before reaching the friend who originally found them and called police.”Four of the men are brothers and the fifth is the adult son of one of the men.
