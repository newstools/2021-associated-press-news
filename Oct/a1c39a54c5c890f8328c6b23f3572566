BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Four additional COVID-19-related deaths occurred over the weekend in North Dakota, but state health officials say the number of active coronavirus cases continues a downward trend. Health officials on Monday reported fewer than 200 news cases sending the number of active cases to 3,030, the lowest level in more than a month. Cases statewide have been trending downward after a recent spike that began in late summer with the onset of the highly contagious delta variant, the  Bismarck Tribune  reported. The coronavirus transmission risk is considered substantial or high in all of North Dakota’s 53 counties, except for Cavalier, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s COVID-19 data tracker website. The CDC recommends people in those risk categories wear masks in public indoor settings.
