MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — More than $324,000 in grants is going to eight projects to benefit Vermont fruit, vegetable and value-added producers and to expand access to locally produced food, the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets said Friday. The grants are funded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Among the recipients are the Vermont Tree Nut Processors to establish a tree nut processing facility in Vermont and to produce cold-pressed culinary nut oils; Addison County Relocalization Network to increase wholesale market opportunities for specialty crop farms in that region; and the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association to expand Vermont maple syrup consumption through a marketing campaign, the agency said. “This year’s Specialty Crop Block Grant funding will promote industry resiliency in the face of rapid market changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increase wholesale market opportunities for farmers, support the emerging Vermont tree nut industry, sponsor grower-led events and educational opportunities, and invest in research to improve fruit and vegetable production methods and control pests,” Vermont Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts said in a written statement.
