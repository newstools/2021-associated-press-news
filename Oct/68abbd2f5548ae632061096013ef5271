More are visiting during March, April and May, park officials said.Summertime remains hectic, though, with this past July the busiest in park history.Park officials are studying tourism patterns and how other parks are handling more visitors, said Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins.ADVERTISEMENT“The visitor experience is a resource, just like moose or clean air, and it’s something we are actively working to preserve and protect,” Jenkins said.Yellowstone officials announced earlier that the park just north of Grand Teton got almost 4.5 million recreation visits through September. This is the first year Yellowstone has seen more than 4 million visitors.Yellowstone had just under 4 million visits in 2016.
