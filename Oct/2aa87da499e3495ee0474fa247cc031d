SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. (AP) — Ready to put a stake in a word that just irritates you?Lake Superior State University is accepting candidates for its 47th annual tongue-in-cheek list of words or phrases that should be banished.The deadline to submit online entries is 8 a.m. EST on Nov. 30. The results will be announced on Dec. 31.COVID-19 lingo dominated the list last year, including “COVID-19,” “social distancing” and the much-repeated phrase, “We’re all in this together.” “You’d better believe that every year we look forward to what sets off grammarians, philosophers, pundits, lovers of language, and haters of miscommunication in the public interest, if you will,” said LSSU President Rodney Hanley.With that remark, Hanley covered some of the 1,000-plus banned words or phrases in the Lake Superior State archive. The late W.T. Rabe, who was public relations director, and faculty came up with the first list at a New Year’s Eve party in 1975.
