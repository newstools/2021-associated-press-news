It is now known as Upper Valley Stewardship Center, The Caledonian-Record reported.Bunnell, an avid skier, wanted to convert the property into a winter ski trail after years of completing all different types of outdoor activities on the property except skiing.He said he began converting the land himself until he got in touch with a local skiing organization, the Granite Backcountry Alliance. After a year of negotiations, they got to work.ADVERTISEMENTA month ago, volunteers from the alliance helped develop five different trails and two uphill routes on sections of the property.
