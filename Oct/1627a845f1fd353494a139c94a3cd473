BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Department of Health has confirmed a human case of West Nile virus for the first time since 2017, the department said Wednesday. The Chittenden County resident was diagnosed earlier this month with a more serious form of the illness affecting the nervous system, called neuroinvasive disease, the Health Department said. West Nile virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and it’s been found in all Vermont counties. Most people who get infected do not get sick from the virus and fewer than 1% develop more severe illness, the department said. About 20% of infected people get flu-like symptoms, officials said. Fourteen human cases of West Nile virus have been confirmed in Vermont since 2003, the Health Department said.
