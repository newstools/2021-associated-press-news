JERICHO, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Army National Guard is holding a public tour of the Camp Ethan Allen Training Site in Jericho on Friday. The tour will be mostly outside and include an overview of the Vermont Army National Guard organization and capabilities, a visit to the biathlon course and a look at the construction site of a new Army Mountain Warfare School, the Guard said. “This tour program represents another opportunity for us to engage with our communities,” said Maj. Gen. Greg Knight, Vermont adjutant general, in a written statement. “The range has been here for a long time, but many people have never had the opportunity to see what kind of training occurs here.”Those interested in taking the tour must register by completing the contact form located online at www.vtguard.com/CEATS. The tour starts at 9 a.m. and attendees are asked to meet at the Joint Readiness Center between 8:30 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. Photo identification is required.
