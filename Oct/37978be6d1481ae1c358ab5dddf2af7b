JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — An Alabama business is developing a new residential and commercial area in Mississippi’s capital city.The Village at Livingston will be near the Jackson Medical Mall in the northwestern part of the city.The project is at the site of former Hood Furniture Manufacturing facility, which has been unused for about 40 years. The factory was torn down, and the project is being developed by Retail Specialists of Birmingham, Alabama.“This project does more than build homes. It builds community,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said as leaders broke ground Thursday.Jackson has lost population the past three decades and has had few new housing developments.News outlets report the first phase will be construction of about 200 homes, estimated to sell between $225,000 to $250,000. The second phase will have commercial and retail spaces.ADVERTISEMENT“From someone who is from Jackson, who grew up in Virden Addition — which is just a few miles down the road — and who came in this area in high school when it was booming, it’s just a pleasure for me to see that it may boom again,” investor Robert Gibbs told WAPT-TV. “This is the catalyst of doing that.”Sen. John Horhn of Jackson said in a news release that the project could revitalize the area.“This project represents one of the most important housing developments in Jackson over the past generation,” Horhn said.
