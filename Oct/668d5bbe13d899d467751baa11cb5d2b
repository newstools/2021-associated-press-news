TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A federal lawsuit has been filed against a northern Michigan county and jail officials alleging that a 20-year-old inmate was denied access to prescribed medication to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms.The suit was filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Cyrus Patson of Traverse City.Patson was being held for a bond violation at the Grand Traverse County Correctional Facility where he said he was not allowed to take Suboxone.ACLU attorney Syeda Davidson said the organization received complaints from other inmates at the jail who said they were not receiving physician-prescribed medications to treat addiction, the Traverse City Record-Eagle reported  Thursday.ADVERTISEMENTThe lawsuit claims that denying medication to inmates with opioid use disorder violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. It asks the court to compel the jail to provide people who are incarcerated with medically assisted treatment for opioid use disorder if prescribed, Davidson said.Grand Traverse County Prosecutor Noelle Moeggenberg told the newspaper that once her office receives the legal paperwork the case will be referred to the county’s insurance carrier.
