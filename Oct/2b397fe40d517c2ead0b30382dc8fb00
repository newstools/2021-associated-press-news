FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Cumberland Valley Electric, an eastern Kentucky electric cooperative, will be part of the state’s high-speed internet expansion efforts, Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman announced Monday. Earlier this year, Kentucky joined neighboring states in establishing new regulations that allow local internet providers and state-owned middle-mile networks to use electric co-ops’ existing infrastructure. This allows electric cooperatives to distribute internet services to unserved or underserved households and businesses. “Functional internet is as important as electricity in 2021,” Coleman said. “Today’s announcement places a deserved greater value in providing every single Kentuckian with fast, reliable internet and building an economy of the future.”
