BALTIMORE (AP) — A little more than half of Baltimore city workers have complied with the city’s coronavirus vaccine requirement, city officials said Wednesday, three days after the mandate went into effect. On Monday, when the city’s 14,000 workers were directed to report their vaccination status, Stefanie Mavronis, spokeswoman for Mayor Brandon Scott, said about 48% had complied, but that grew to 56% by Wednesday, The Baltimore Sun reported. The rate mirrors the vaccination rate for city residents, with 56% fully vaccinated, according to state data.Those who aren’t fully vaccinated will be subject to weekly coronavirus testing, city officials have said. Testing is scheduled to begin Monday.The city’s policy states that unvaccinated employees who don’t submit to testing won’t be allowed in any city workplace and will be subject to discipline up to and including termination.ADVERTISEMENTSome unions representing city employees encouraged members to push back. After a meeting with city representatives, the police union announced Saturday that it won’t takelegal action as it previously threatened.City officials are developing an outreach strategy for departments with lower compliance rates to make sure employees have access to the payroll system to report their statuses and if needed, vaccination clinics, Mavronis said.
