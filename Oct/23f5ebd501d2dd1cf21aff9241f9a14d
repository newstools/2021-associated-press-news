NEWPORT, Vt. (AP) — The state of Vermont is hoping to stem a spike in COVID-19 cases by making it easier for people to get vaccinated or receive booster shots in the northeastern corner of the state known as the Northeast Kingdom. The three counties that make up the region, Orleans, Essex and Caledonia, have among the lowest vaccination rates in the state. And Orleans County has the highest rate of COVID-19 infection in the northeastern United States. A number of walk-in mobile clinics are being offered on Saturday and Sunday. Other clinics have been scheduled throughout the state through Nov. 6. People can check the health department website  for actual times and locations. “I encourage all those who live in the area and who are eligible for the vaccine or a booster to take advantage of these opportunities,” said Governor Phil Scott. “The vaccines are free, they are safe, and—most importantly—they work.”
