LAS VEGAS (AP) — Elected leaders of the fifth-largest school district in the nation fired their chief administrator of Las Vegas-area schools late Thursday during a marathon meeting following weeks of infighting and anger from parents and teachers over coronavirus pandemic regulations.Clark County School District trustees didn’t specify a reason for their 4-3 vote to end Superintendent Jesus Jara’s contract “for convenience.”Jara, who was hired in 2018 and received a contract extension last May, moved his face mask aside and offered parting words that alluded to behind-the-scenes conflict with the seven-member board, then got up and left. “While some members of this board seek to continue and try to run the operations of this school district and micro-manage me and undermine staff, I have been dedicated to protecting the staff from overreach and interference,” Jara said. “My focus on student achievement and well-being have never and will never waiver in my career,” he said. “Unfortunately, the majority of this board did not share the same vision for this community and the children will suffer because of it.”In May, the board voted 4-3 to extend Jara’s contract, ending debate about whether it had already automatically renewed and about Jara’s management style. Trustee Irene Cepeda supported Jara then, but voted to oust him Thursday.Jara’s firing “for convenience” means he may be entitled to his annual salary of $320,000 until January 2023.Jara had faced criticism about information his administration provided to the board and state lawmakers, as well as his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.Parents and others have protested mask mandates; diversity and the teaching of critical race theory; and the decision last year to operate with 100% distance education for about a year starting in March 2020.Jara becomes the sixth schools chief to be removed among the largest seven districts in the country, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. In Florida, Alberto Carvalho remains superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, the fourth-largest district in the U.S.The Las Vegas-based Clark County system has some 315,000 students and 18,000 teachers in 336 schools covering an area the size of New Jersey.Jara is the third superintendent leaving amid turmoil at key school districts in Nevada.In Reno, Superintendent Kristen McNeill announced last month she’ll retire at the end of the academic year next June, ending her tenure as the third superintendent to head the Washoe County School District in 10 years. McNeill replaced former Superintendent Traci Davis, whose firing in 2019 led to a $70,000 settlement in a retirement benefits lawsuit.In Elko, a retired former superintendent took over Aug. 31 as interim district chief after the former top administrator abruptly resigned in June and five of seven school trustees stepped down in August. The district in largely conservative northeast Nevada has seen contentious debate about coronavirus mitigation mask mandates, staff vaccine requirements and COVID-19 testing.Jara’s removal came after two hours of passionate public comment and contentious debate between trustees in the district’s cramped board meeting room.The meeting then continued for several more hours, into early Friday morning, with Trustee Katie Williams leaving after refusing multiple requests from board President Linda Cavazos’ to wear a facial covering. The meeting ended after trustees voted to postpone action on Trustee Lola Brooks’ bid to strip Cavazos of her leadership role.Brooks, who has criticized Cavazos and voted to support Jara, observed that one thing everyone could agree on was that “this isn’t working.”An interim replacement for Jara was not immediately identified. Schools and district administrative offices were closed Friday for the Nevada Day state holiday.
