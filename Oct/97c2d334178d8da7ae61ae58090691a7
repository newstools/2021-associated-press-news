WINFIELD, W.Va. (AP) — A West Virginia teachers union is suing a county board of education over its COVID-19 policies.The West Virginia Education Association filed the lawsuit Monday against the Putnam County Board of Education.

Masks will become mandatory for at least five days if 25% of a high school’s students test positive or if 15% of an elementary or middle school’s students test positive.Union President Dale Lee said in a statement that the board “is not willing to make any changes in order to comply with the regulations.
