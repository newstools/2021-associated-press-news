GORHAM, Maine (AP) — The Maine attorney general’s office has cleared a police officer in a shooting of a man who resisted arrest in a confrontation in a parking lot two years ago.A report released Monday said Officer Dean Hannon shot and killed Kyle Needham, 32, in a Gorham parking lot after he ignored officers’ orders to turn off his car and show his hands. Needham was wanted on an arrest warrant from a high-speed chase and probation violations, The Portland Press Herald reported.The report also said Needham accelerated his truck in an attempt to flee from officers instead of complying with them. Needham then backed up his truck and knocked one of the officers to the ground.When Hannon shot Needham, he believed that the other officer and the civilians in the shopping mall parking lot were at imminent risk of death or serious bodily injury, the report said.Needham died of a single gunshot wound to his chest and abdomen, the newspaper said.According to Maine law, an officer is permitted to use deadly force when they believe it is necessary for self-defense or to defend others.
