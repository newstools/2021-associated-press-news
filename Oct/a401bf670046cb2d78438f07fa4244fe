PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Maine health care centers are facing a staffing crunch during the COVID-19 pandemic, but vaccination mandates are not the cause, the chief of the largest health network in the state said Tuesday.Maine Health Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mueller said during a news conference that the organization has a staff vacancy rate of about 10%. He described that level of staffing loss as “really, really difficult” for the organization, especially at a time when hospitals are full.However, Mueller said, the shortage can be attributed to an aging workforce and workers leaving the industry due to the stress of working during the pandemic. He said the coming vaccine mandate will likely improve staffing because hospitals will lose fewer workers to illness.“It’s very clear it helps to preserve and protect our workforce,” Mueller said, adding that 2% of workforce might leave when the state mandate goes into effect.ADVERTISEMENTThe state’s COVID-19 mandate for health workers goes into effect Oct. 29.
