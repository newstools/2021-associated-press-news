CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — The state’s indoor mask mandate for people vaccinated for COVID-19 will be lifted Friday for Nevada’s least populous county while more stringent requirements remain in place in the rest of the state.The coronavirus has remained at low transmission levels in Esmeralda County in rural southwest Nevada for two weeks, allowing the mandate to be lifted for people who are vaccinated, Nevada Health Response officials said Tuesday.The requirement for indoor masking remains in place for unvaccinated people in Esmeralda County, which has fewer than 1,000 residents.Mask mandates remain in place for all people, whether vaccinated or not, in all other counties, including Clark and Washoe, counties where the state’s major population centers are located in metro Las Vegas and Reno, because transmission remain at high or substantial levels, officials said.
