LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Two Nebraska state senators are making a longshot push for a special legislative session to bar businesses from requiring that their employees get coronavirus vaccinations. Sens. Ben Hansen, of Blair, and Rob Clements, of Elmwood, have been circulating a petition among their fellow lawmakers to try to build enough support for a special session.At least 10 senators would need to sign the petition before it could go to Secretary of State Bob Evnen.Evnen would then poll all 49 state senators to see if they would support a special session. At least 33 would need to support the idea, which is unlikely to happen given the current makeup of the Legislature.The proposed special session would also focus on prohibiting governments and schools from mandating COVID-19 vaccinations.Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican like Hansen and Clements, has said he opposes vaccine mandates but would only call a special session if enough lawmakers express support to actually pass a ban.Lawmakers are scheduled to return for their regular session in January.
