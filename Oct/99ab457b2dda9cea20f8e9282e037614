RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) — A beloved Halloween tradition in the city of Rutland is returning after being cancelled last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Rutland Halloween Parade takes place Saturday evening starting at 6:30 p.m., and includes 71 floats, according to Recreation Superintendent Kim Peters.“We’re getting it back on its feet,” she said. “We’re excited. We have a lot of volunteers.”The 60-year-old parade has drawn up to 20,000 spectators some years. “We’re going as big as we can pull together,” Rutland business owner Ed Larson told NECN. “A lot of folks look forward to it all year.”Marchers and people on the floats will no longer throw candy into the crowd. Instead members of the Rutland High School Key Club will distribute more than 5,000 prepackaged bags of candy to children along the parade route, Peters told the Rutland Herald. That way children will not be ducking under the ropes and into the street after candy creating a safety hazard, according to Peters.“It’s a big safety issue,” she said.
