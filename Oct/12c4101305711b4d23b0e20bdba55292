For the first time this season, there are no games on the college football schedule matching two ranked teams. That doesn’t mean there aren’t some intriguing matchups.In the spotlight are a handful of teams that stumbled early and fell out of the rankings, but now have a chance to get their seasons pointed in the right direction.Clemson’s fall from College Football Playoff contender to unranked with two losses before October has been one of the biggest developments of 2021. The Tigers have yet to score more than 20 points in regulation against an FBS opponent, but they are still very much in play for a seventh straight Atlantic Coast Conference championship.In a role reversal, Clemson (4-2) visits No. 23 Pittsburgh as a dangerous underdog.Wisconsin (3-3) already has a couple of Big Ten losses and is trying to sort out an offense averaging fewer than 20 points per game. Still, the Badgers have a reasonable path to win the Big Ten West if they can knock off newly ranked No. 25 Purdue.ADVERTISEMENTRemember Iowa State? The Cyclones started the season ranked in the top 10, got off to their usual slow start and have hardly been heard from since.College footballNo. 6 Buckeyes guard against slip-up against reeling HuskersAkron fires coach Tom Arth after 2-plus seasons, 3-24 recordNo. 23 SMU visits Memphis, aims to bounce back from 1st lossNo. 18 Kentucky, Tennessee seek to end 2-game SEC slidesBrock Purdy and Co. get a prime chance to re-enter the Big 12 picture when they host No. 8 Oklahoma State.
