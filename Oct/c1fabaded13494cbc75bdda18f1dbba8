BRUSSELS (AP) — Nine European Union countries, including heavyweight Germany, have joined forces to say they will not support an overhaul of the electricity market ahead of an emergency meeting of the bloc’s energy ministers Tuesday in Luxembourg. The energy crisis impacting consumers’ bills and businesses has been widely acknowledged by EU leaders, but setting up a common response within the bloc’s 27 member states to weather its impact is proving problematic.With the hike in energy prices expected to last at least until spring, member countries agreed last week that a series of measures proposed by the EU executive arm, including bill payment deferrals and tax cuts, should be implemented to tackle the short term effects.But a rift has emerged between countries calling for a thorough reform of the bloc’s energy market — among them France and Spain — and those who believe the crisis is only temporary and does not require radical market changes.

According to EU officials, gas prices have increased by more than 170% since the start of the year.Among proposals put forward by Spain is the idea of setting up a joint procurement program for gas reserves. Currently, the EU depends heavily on imported gas, mainly from Russia.
