Marshall’s Taevion Kinsey believes he’s heading into his senior year as a better and more relaxed player after debating whether to turn pro during the offseason.He also has come back as a bigger player.Kinsey entered his name into NBA draft consideration before announcing prior to the draft that he would return to school. The 6-foot-5 guard now enters his senior season as one of the top college basketball players from outside the major conferences.“I got some great feedback from guys in the NBA,” Kinsey said. “I’ve got a lot of NBA guys now – players and coaches – who reach out now and try to help me. That’s a big plus going into this year.”Kinsey averaged 19.5 points and 6.2 rebounds last season to lead Marshall in both categories and earn first-team all-Conference USA honors. He bulked up in the offseason without losing the athleticism that has made him an intriguing pro prospect.ADVERTISEMENT“He’s about 15 pounds heavier and his vertical’s the same,” Marshall coach Dan D’Antoni said.Kinsey also spent the offseason trying to improve his shooting. Kinsey says the 2020-21 season was a little stressful for him as he weighed his options.Now that he’s tested the draft waters and has a greater understanding of how he must improve before he launches his pro career, Kinsey is feeling better.“Me going through that process, I think it took a lot of weight off my shoulders for me to just play freely this year and not have to worry about things,” Kinsey said.Kinsey is among the under-the-radar players who bear watching during the upcoming college basketball season. For the purposes of this list, we considered players from outside the six major conferences (the Power Five and Big East). We also didn’t include players from No. 1  Gonzaga and No. 15 Houston, which didn’t exactly fit the under-the-radar profile  after reaching the Final Four last season. The same goes for No. 12 Memphis, which brought in the nation’s No. 1 recruiting class.ORAL ROBERTS: G Max AbmasADVERTISEMENTThis 6-footer averaged 24.5 points to lead all Division I players last season and thrived in the spotlight while helping Oral Roberts reach the Sweet 16.
