NEW YORK (AP) — New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio separately received COVID-19 booster shots Monday as part of their efforts to promote widespread vaccinations.The two Democrats, who received their shots at different events, were eligible because they had each received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine earlier this year.De Blasio, 60, got a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine from city Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi during the mayor’s regular online news briefing.“Give me a boost, Dave,” de Blasio said.Hochul, 63, got her Moderna booster at public ribbon cutting at the Decker College of Nursing and Health Sciences in Johnson City, near Binghamton.“Didn’t even feel a thing,” she said to applause.
