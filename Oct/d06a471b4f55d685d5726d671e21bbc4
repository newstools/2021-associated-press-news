EAST MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — A school district in central Vermont said Wednesday it may have been hit with a ransomware attack. WCAX-TV reports the superintendent of the Washington Central Unified Union School District said the district’s information systems were compromised as a result of a suspected ransomware attack. Interim Superintendent Jen Miller-Arsenault said it is not clear if any information, including student information, was accessed and that local, state and federal law enforcement had been notified. The school has asked experts and independent investigators to assess the nature and extent of the disruption. So far, the school is still operating mostly as normal. The Washington Central Unified Union School District includes five elementary schools and a joint middle and high school for the central Vermont towns of Berlin, Calais, East Montpelier, Middlesex and Worcester.
