Some things to watch in Week 8 of the Big 12 Conference:GAME OF THE WEEKNo. 8 Oklahoma State at Iowa State. While the Cowboys (6-0, 3-0 Big 12) have surprised many with their undefeated start, Iowa State (4-2, 2-1) was a Top 10 team at the beginning of the season before a notable home loss to Iowa and then falling at Baylor in their Big 12 opener. The Cyclones could still get back in position to make their second consecutive Big 12 championship game. A win over Oklahoma State would provide a big boost. Both teams still have games remaining against third-ranked and six-time defending champion Oklahoma. While Oklahoma State has won five of the past six games against Iowa State, none of those games have been decided by more than seven points.
