LOS ANGELES (AP) — Receiver Odell Beckham Jr., safety Jordan Fuller and eight of their Los Angeles Rams teammates went on the reserve/COVID-19 list Tuesday, giving the Rams 13 total players on the list after the latest expansion of their virus outbreak.Defensive backs Terrell Burgess and Juju Hughes, tight end Brycen Hopkins, tackle Alaric Jackson, injured nose tackle Sebastian Joseph-Day and practice squad members Jonah Williams and Tyler Hall also went on the list Tuesday. Only Beckham and Fuller have played regularly in a major role for the Rams (9-4) this season.Coach Sean McVay said the Rams have shut down their training complex in Thousand Oaks for at least two days under the NFL’s intensive protocols. They will conduct meetings virtually Wednesday and won’t hold a practice, although they were unlikely to hold a significant workout anyway on a short week of preparation to host Seattle on Sunday.“I am very surprised, because you feel like you’re behind it when everybody is vaccinated and you’re moving in the right direction,” McVay said Tuesday before the latest round of moves had been announced. “Without a doubt, we have never experienced anything of this magnitude as it relates to COVID. This is definitely something that’s been eye-opening.”ADVERTISEMENTCoronavirus pandemicData indicate omicron is milder, better at evading vaccinesS.
