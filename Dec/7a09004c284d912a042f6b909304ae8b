LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Kansas has confirmed a second case of the highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus.The Lawrence Journal-World reports  that the Kansas Department of Health and Environment notified the Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health on Friday that the variant had been found in the community. The announcement came one just day after the state’s first case of the variant was confirmed Thursday  in neighboring Franklin County. Dr. Jennifer Schrimsher, deputy county health officer and infectious disease physician at LMH Health, said detection of the variant in the county does not come as a surprise as it has rapidly spread across the country since the first confirmed U.S. case of Omicron was identified on Dec. 1.ADVERTISEMENT“This virus is highly infectious and transmittable,” she said. “Vaccines remain the best public health measure to protect people from COVID-19, slow transmission and reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging.”Health officials said the individual with the omicron variant in Douglas County is a vaccinated adult who has received a booster dose. No other information about the individual was released.
