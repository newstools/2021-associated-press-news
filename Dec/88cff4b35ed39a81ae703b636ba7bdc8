TURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Seahawks plus-3; Texans plus-1.SEAHAWKS PLAYER TO WATCH: Ryan Neal returns to the starting lineup at strong safety with Jamal Adams out for the season following shoulder surgery. Neal has been used in spots throughout the season as a sixth defensive back but has not played consistently. When Adams missed time with injuries in 2020, Neal played very well in a starting role. The issue for Seattle is putting Neal into the starting lineup limits the Seahawks’ ability to play packages with six defensive backs.

Coach David Culley said Friday that Tyrod Taylor has been benched for Mills for the rest of the season. Culley said he believes Mills, a rookie from Stanford, gives Houston its best chance to win. Culley pulled Taylor in the third quarter last week and replaced him with Mills before making the benching permanent Friday. Mills threw eight interceptions with seven touchdowns in 6 ½ games filling in when Taylor was injured. Taylor has five interceptions with just two TD passes in the four games since returning from a strained hamstring. KEY MATCHUP: Seattle QB Russell Wilson vs. Houston’s pass defense. The Texans have been atrocious against the run but not terrible against the pass this season. Now they’ll face a quarterback who has thrown for more than 200 yards in three of four games since returning a finger injury, though Wilson has not approached his previous peak form.
