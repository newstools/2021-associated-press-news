INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A 16-year-old boy was charged Friday with three counts of murder in the October deaths of three young men whose bodies were found in a field in Indianapolis.Marion County prosecutors charged Caden Smith of Indianapolis as an adult in the deaths, along with felony charges of robbery resulting in serious injury and illegal possession of a machine gun.An off-duty police officer found the three bodies Oct. 12 while working security at a construction site near Interstate 465 on the city’s south side. The Marion County coroner’s office determined the victims — Joseph Thomas, 18; Michael James, 22; and Abdulla Mubarak, 17 — all died from gunshot wounds. Smith was identified as a suspect through his communication with the three victims before their deaths, the prosecutor’s office said. The charges against Smith include allegations that he stole guns or cell phones from the victims during the attacks.ADVERTISEMENTPolice officers found the gun that investigators believe was used in the killings during a search of his grandmother’s home where he lived, according to court documents.Court records didn’t yet list a defense attorney for Smith on Friday. An initial court hearing wasn’t immediately scheduled.
