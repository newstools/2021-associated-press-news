The key in Nashville could be Tennessee’s defense against the Niners’ rushing game. Tennessee has allowed a total of 43 yards rushing combined over the past two games.

He’s the first receiver in the Super Bowl era to do that and the third 49ers player since the 1970 merger to have a TD run in at least five straight games.Coronavirus pandemicEXPLAINER: What to do if you test positive for COVID-19Live updates: S Korea has new daily high for COVID-19 deathsPfizer pill becomes 1st US-authorized home COVID treatmentNYC adds testing; no decision on Times Square New Year's EveThe 49ers (8-6) have won five of six games and are 5-2 on the road.
