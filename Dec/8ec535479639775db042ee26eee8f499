MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo could be returning to action for the Milwaukee Bucks just in time for Christmas, as he isn’t listed on the Bucks’ injury report for Saturday’s game. That doesn’t guarantee the two-time MVP will be be back on the court for the holiday matchup against the Boston Celtics after spending time in the NBA’s COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Milwaukee has gone 3-2 over the five-game stretch without Antetokounmpo. He ranks fourth in the NBA in scoring (27.0) and sixth in rebounding (11.6).The Bucks’ injury report also doesn’t include forward Bobby Portis, and lists guard Donte DiVincenzo as questionable due to the health and safety protocols. Portis hasn’t played since Dec. 15 due to the protocols. DiVincenzo hasn’t played since tearing a ligament in his left ankle in a first-round playoff series with Miami last season,  but he was expected to make his season debut just before the protocols made him unavailable last week.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
