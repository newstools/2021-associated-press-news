The NFL’s leading rusher has been getting a seemingly heavier workload each week. If Wentz doesn’t play, expect Las Vegas to gang up against the run. One potential wrinkle — Ehlinger’s ability to exploit coach Frank Reich’s run-pass option plays.KEY INJURIES: The Raiders hope to get TE Darren Waller back after missing the previous four games because of knee and back injuries. Las Vegas had five starters on the reserve/COVID-19 list — CB Casey Hayward, LB Denzel Perryman, CB Brandon Facyson, WR Bryan Edwards, and S Roderic Teamer. ... The revised COVID-19 protocols could help Indy get most, or all, of its players back Sunday. Five players returned to practice Wednesday and more, including LB Darius Leonard, are expected this week. Starting center Ryan Kelly is expected to return after missing three straight games. Reich won’t know about LT Eric Fisher (knee, toe, pectoral muscle), TE Jack Doyle (knee and ankle) or S Andrew Sendejo (concussion protocol) until later this week.SERIES NOTES: Indianapolis has won six of the last eight but road teams have won three in a row. ...

Indy’s 31 takeaways are nine short of this season’s goal but the Colts still lead the league in points off turnovers (122).FANTASY TIP: Indy defense. Taylor is a tempting pick, as usual, especially against a defense ranked No. 19 against the run. But Carr and the Raiders have struggled mightily to protect the ball, especially recently. Expect the Colts to be hungry for takeaways after the short-handed unit forced none last week.___More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
