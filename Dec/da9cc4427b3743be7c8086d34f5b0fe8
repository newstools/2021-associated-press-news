MADRID (AP) — Players from Spain’s top two divisions will undergo daily antigen tests for COVID-19 according to new health protocols established by the Spanish league on Wednesday.The league said that 95% of players have received two doses of vaccines, but “with the appearance of new variants like omicron, it is necessary to not drop our guard.”The league, which runs the top two divisions, is tightening controls to face a new wave of infections driven by the more contagious omicron variant. So far only one game — this week’s Lugo vs. Almeria match in the second division — has been postponed after Lugo detected an outbreak that infected 23 people.But La Liga leader Real Madrid has been hard hit  as well, with eight reported infections on its first squad, including star midfielder Luka Modric.ADVERTISEMENTThe new protocol mandates antigen testing each day a player joins his teammates. The same goes for coaching staff and any club workers in contact with the team. Until now, a player had an antigen test before the first training session following a game, followed by a second test 48 hours later, a third test 48 hours before a match, and a fourth test before a game.Coronavirus pandemicEXPLAINER: What to do if you test positive for COVID-19Live updates: S Korea has new daily high for COVID-19 deathsPfizer pill becomes 1st US-authorized home COVID treatmentNYC adds testing; no decision on Times Square New Year's EveThe league will give 60 tests for each team to use each day.Players will also undergo a more precise PCR test each week at least until Jan. 15, the league said.
