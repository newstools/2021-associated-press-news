PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Rhode Island residents ages 16 and older are now eligible for a booster dose of the Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19.The Rhode Island health department announced Friday that it was expanding booster dose eligibility because U.S. health authorities had again expanded the nation’s booster campaign, opening extra doses of Pfizer’s vaccine to several million 16- and 17-year-olds.On Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration gave emergency authorization for 16- and 17-year-olds to get a third dose of the vaccine made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech — once they’re six months past their last dose. And hours later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted the last barrier as Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the agency’s director, issued a statement strongly encouraging those teens to get their booster as soon as it’s time.

Dan McKee and state health officials are encouraging residents ages 16 and older to get a booster six months after their Pfizer or Moderna primary series or two months after their Johnson & Johnson vaccination. Only Pfizer booster doses are being administered to teenagers.Coronavirus pandemicNew UK mask rules start as Johnson under fire over partiesCourt won't order hospital to use deworming drug on man Colorado COVID exposure app getting a lot of use amid surgeHamas says oxygen bottles exploded in Lebanon camp, not arms“As eligibility continues to expand, we’re making accessibility a priority for Rhode Island’s booster campaign,” McKee said in a statement. “If you are eligible, get that booster and encourage friends and family to sign up today.” The state has had a high level of transmission since August. A holiday-season spike in cases and hospitalizations has hit even New England, one of the most highly inoculated corners of the country.
