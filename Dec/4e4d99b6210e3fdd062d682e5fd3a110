HONOLULU (AP) — A U.S. senator is calling for the Environmental Protection Agency to take the lead in testing to determine whether water the Navy provides to and around Pearl Harbor is safe to drink.U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz said he is calling for the EPA to step in after the Navy disputed the Hawaii Department of Health’s analysis of fuel contamination at a well that provides drinking water to the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam’s water system. Military households have complained about their tap water, with some saying they suffered ailments such as cramps and vomiting after drinking it.Testing showed the presence of petroleum in water that comes from a well near the underground fuel tank complex that has been the source of multiple fuel leaks over the years.Schatz wants the EPA to be the lead agency handling collection, testing, analysis and public communication of the water crisis.ADVERTISEMENT“We can’t afford another day of the Navy and the state and county agencies disagreeing on the basic question of whether the drinking water is safe,” he said in a statement Thursday.The EPA is providing support, Julia Giarmoleo, an agency spokesperson, told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser. The EPA isn’t independently testing the water, but reviewing Navy test results, Giarmoleo said.
