A 4-year-old boy secured in a child safety seat was taken to a hospital with serious injuries.The driver of the tractor-trailer was treated at the scene for minor injuries. State police declined to release the children’s names because state law prohibits them from identifying a juvenile victim of a crime and charges may yet be filed.
