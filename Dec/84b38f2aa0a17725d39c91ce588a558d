DETROIT (AP) — Construction has started on a $10.8 million development on Detroit’s westside that will include 38 affordable housing units along with commercial space.The Sawyer Art Apartments are part of the Strategic Neighborhood Fund initiative, a partnership between the city and Invest Detroit, according to the city.The block-long development will go up along the city’s recently completed McNichols streetscape. Housing rates will be listed at between 60% and 80% area median income and designed to help more residents afford quality housing.Retail spaces will be offered at reduced rates to entrepreneurs to help bring even more life to the area’s commercial corridor.The building is expected to be completed in 2023. The development replaces a long vacant auto service station and two vacant buildings.URGE Development Group, N’Namdi Holdings and Hosey Development are the project’s developers.ADVERTISEMENT“The Sawyer Art Apartments is a great example of Detroiters rebuilding Detroit in a way that is affordable for the residents who stayed in this community,” Mayor Mike Duggan said. “This is a development team from Detroit that is truly community-focused. This new development will build on the energy and revitalization we have been witnessing along McNichols since we completed our streetscape project this fall.”
