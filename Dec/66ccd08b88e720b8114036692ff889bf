OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The average number of people hospitalized in Oklahoma Friday with COVID-19 topped 600 the for the first time in more than two months as the number of cases rise in the state, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said.The three-day average of virus hospitalizations was 616, the most since Oct. 25, according to health department records. The department also reported 3,003 new cases, the largest one-day increase since Oct. 9 and a seven-day average of 1,561, surpassing 1,500 for the first time since Sept. 30. State health officials have reported no cases caused by the omicron variant, which the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports has been found in at least 23 states.ADVERTISEMENTThe increase in Oklahoma is likely due to Halloween and Thanksgiving gatherings and more people being indoors as the weather cools, health officials have said.Scientists say it was inevitable the omicron variant would reach the U.S. and believe it may have been in the country before it was detected.Scientists are trying to determine whether omicron spreads more easily or causes more severe disease than the delta variant that now dominates in the U.S. They are also studying how well current vaccines work against it.
