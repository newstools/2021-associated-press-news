She agreed to a plea deal with prosecutors in August, less than a month before she was scheduled to face trial.Palatella was accused of paying $500,000 to get her son into the University of Southern California as a football recruit even though he wouldn’t really play on the team. Prosecutors said she also paid $75,000 to cheat on her son’s college entrance exam.Prosecutors previously agreed to dismiss the other charge she was facing — conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery — in exchange for her guilty plea.ADVERTISEMENTHer sentence also includes two years of supervised release, a $250,000 fine and 500 hours of community service.Palatella was among 50 parents, athletic coaches and others charged in the case in 2019 that embroiled elite universities across the country.More than 30 other parents have pleaded guilty, including TV actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin and Loughlin’s fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli.
