NEW ORLEANS (AP) — After a two-year absence brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, the Essence Festival is planning its return to New Orleans next summer. “Given what we have collectively experienced over the last two years, the opportunity to convene and uplift in the spirit of culture, equity, celebration — and joy — is more of a privilege and honor than it has ever been,” said Caroline Wanga, chief executive officer of Essence Communications Inc. The festival, launched in 1995 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Essence magazine, has evolved into the world’s largest celebration of Black women, culture and communities, convening more than 530,000 people annually over July 4th weekend in New Orleans, the company said in a news release.Scheduled for June 30 to July 3, the festival will include programming on networking, finance, career, wellness, fashion, beauty and more at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, nightly concerts at the Superdome and other entertainment in venues across the city.
