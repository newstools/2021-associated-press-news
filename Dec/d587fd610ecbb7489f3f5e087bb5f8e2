HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Some Connecticut school districts have decided to discontinue the state’s “screen and stay” policy that was designed to keep kids in school even if they’d had close contact with someone testing positive for COVID-19.The voluntary policy was introduced by Gov. Ned Lamont in early November and calls for children exposed to the virus, even if they are not vaccinated, to remain in school as long as they wear masks and do not develop COVID-19 symptoms. But some schools have decided to end that policy because of the recent surge in cases, which have been linked to the highly transmissible omicron variant of the virus.West Hartford school officials announced Monday they were scrapping the program. That same day, they announced 13 people in the district tested positive for COVID-19.“West Hartford and Bloomfield have rescinded because of the number of cases that we’ve been seeing,’′ Aimee Krauss, director of the West Hartford-Bloomfield Health District, told The Hartford Courant.ADVERTISEMENTOther towns, including East Windsor and Bristol, have also opted out, the newspaper reported.
