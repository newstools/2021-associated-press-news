I’m following protocol and isolating, &amp; I will miss Lienz. Best of luck to my teammates…I’ll be cheering for you. Thank you all for your support.

She leads Italy’s Sofia Goggia by 115 points in the standings but needs to maintain a high level of points in the technical disciplines of giant slalom and slalom since Goggia has been virtually unbeatable in the speed events of downhill and super-G.Shiffrin’s positive test comes at a particularly bad time for her with six consecutive technical races scheduled.Other top skiers who have missed races recently after testing positive for COVID-19 include former overall champion Lara Gut-Behrami, Austrian world champion Katharina Liensberger and Alice Robinson of New Zealand.Maryna Gąsienica-Daniel, the Polish skier who finished sixth in two giant slaloms in Courchevel, France, last week, also announced a positive test on Monday. She said on Instagram  that she is “isolated at home,” and she, too, will miss the races in Lienz. Gąsienica-Daniel adds that she is “sad” but otherwise “feeling good.”Liensberger and Robinson, who both had to sit out Courchevel, are back on the starting list for Tuesday’s race in Lienz. Gut-Behrami remains out after her positive case was announced 10 days ago.Also, chief race director Peter Gerdol is among two women’s World Cup officials with the International Ski Federation (FIS) who tested positive after the races in Courchevel. Gerdol is being replaced by FIS race director Markus Mayr for the event in Lienz, where no spectators will be allowed.Shiffrin’s Olympic record includes two golds — in slalom at the 2014 Sochi Games and giant slalom at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games — plus a silver in combined in 2018.Shiffrin finished first and second in the last two races she competed in — the two giant slaloms in Courchevel.The next women’s World Cup race after Lienz is a slalom in Zagreb, Croatia, on Jan. 4.___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
