PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Brown University’s cancer center has received a $25 million gift it plans to use to help it earn a National Cancer Institute designation, the highest federal rating for a cancer center.In honor of the gift from life sciences entrepreneur and investor Pablo Legorreta and his wife, Almudena, the center founded last year will be renamed the Legorreta Cancer Center, the Ivy League school announced Thursday.The gift will be used to recruit physician-scientists, leading investigators and other experts, launch research projects, and build an infrastructure to bring innovations to cancer patients.“I’m a passionate believer in the ability of science to advance progress and facilitate change,” Pablo Legorreta said in a statement. “It’s a privilege to be able to support the Brown cancer center’s mission of advancing scientific research to find better ways to treat cancer and improve patient care.”ADVERTISEMENTNational Cancer Institute designation recognizes facilities across the nation that meet rigorous standards focused on developing new approaches to preventing, diagnosing and treating cancer.“In providing the funding to bring aboard first-class talent and launch promising new research programs, this gift brings us closer to realizing the dream of a world-class, federally recognized cancer center right here in the state of Rhode Island,” Brown President Christina Paxson said.
