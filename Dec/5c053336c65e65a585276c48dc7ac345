CHICAGO (AP) — Quarterback Justin Fields will likely miss his second straight game because of an ankle injury when the Chicago Bears host the New York Giants on Sunday.Coach Matt Nagy said Friday that Andy Dalton will start after being sidelined because of a groin injury and Nick Foles will be the backup. Fields is listed as questionable after practicing on a limited basis this week.“Justin is continuing to improve every day, but as I’ve said from the start, we want to make sure that we’re always putting him and these players in the best position possible,” Nagy said. “So, he’s working toward that. If he’s gonna be up, then we’d want him to be the starter. That’s why we’re making that decision.”Fields missed last week’s win at Seattle after getting injured in a Monday night loss to Minnesota. Foles made his first start in 13 months and led the Bears (5-10) to a 25-24 comeback victory. The Super Bowl 52 MVP threw a 15-yard touchdown to Jimmy Graham with about a minute remaining. Damiere Byrd made an acrobatic reception for the 2-point conversion, and Chicago came out on top after losing eight of nine.ADVERTISEMENTNagy said the “pain of the football movements” is limiting Fields. He also said the prized rookie is doing “everything he can” to be ready for the season finale at Minnesota on Jan. 9.___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://apnews.com/hub/pro-32 and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
