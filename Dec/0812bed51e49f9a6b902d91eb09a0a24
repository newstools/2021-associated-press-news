He showed no symptoms when he and his wife tested positive Nov. 25 on their return to France. The wife’s test is being screened for omicron. They have been quarantined at their home since the positive test. A third person living in the same home with the couple was tested on Thursday to determine if they were infected and, if so, if they are carrying the new variant.
