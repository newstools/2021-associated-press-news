BROOKSVILLE, Maine (AP) — A contaminated mine is Brooksville is in line to receive federal funding to assist in the cleanup.The former Callahan Mining Corporation site is one of 49 Superfund sites across the country whose cleanup will be funded with $1 billion from the infrastructure bill signed into law in November, the Bangor Daily News reported.The mine operated from the late 1800s until 1972. Arsenic and lead contamination are found in the site’s soil and rock; copper, lead and zinc are found in high concentrations in the sediment; and polychlorinated biphenyls, better known as PCBs, also have been found.Cleanup at the site has been going on since 2010, and the most recent work started in 2018. ADVERTISEMENTEPA officials hope this funding from the infrastructure bill will pay for the current cleanup phase as well as the start of work to address sediment contamination at the site.But it’s not yet known how much money will be set aside for the project, said Bryan Olson, director of the EPA’s New England Superfund and Emergency Management Division.
