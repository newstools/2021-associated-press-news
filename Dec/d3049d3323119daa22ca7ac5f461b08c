Playoff scenarios will dominate Week 17, which used to be the finale for the regular season. Now, with a 17th game added to the schedule, there are postseason implications nearly everywhere. Among the most intriguing matchups involving two clubs not into the Super Bowl parade but on the fringes will take place in Indianapolis on the only Sunday with 15 NFL matches all year. The Raiders (8-7) and Colts (9-6) go at it. Indy can actually clinch with a victory; there also are machinations that get the Colts in with a tie. Pro Picks ignores ties.“We understand that and we know what’s at stake,” Colts two-time All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard says. “We know we have to come out and play our best ball against these guys. We have to come in and we’ve got to play four great quarters of football if we want to make a playoff push.”The Raiders will advance if they win out.ADVERTISEMENT“We have two games left against two really good football teams and we need to win them,” quarterback Derek Carr says. “If we do and we get in, I think that would be pretty remarkable. I think that would be pretty amazing. But it falls in line with what our plans were at the beginning of the year and despite all the adversity, to be able to still stare your goals in the face and have an opportunity to obtain them, it’s pretty cool.
