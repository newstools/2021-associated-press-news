CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) — A Texas jury has awarded a largely symbolic settlement of more than $301 billion in a lawsuit against a Corpus Christi bar brought by the family of a woman and her 16-year-old granddaughter who were killed in a car crash with a drunken driver.The suit against Beer Belly’s Sports Bar stems from a 2017 crash that killed 59-year-old Tamra Kindred, Aujuni Anderson, and the other driver, Joshua Delbosque. Kindred’s daughters alleged in their suit that the bar served Delbosque a “dangerous amount of alcohol” and that the 29-year-old Delbosque later ran a red light at 91 mph, causing the crash. A Nueces County jury awarded the eye-popping figure to Jennifer Kindred and Elizabeth Anderson on Tuesday, but their lawyer said the women don’t expert to receive payment from the now-closed bar. Beer Belly’s and its owner were ordered to pay them $1.04 billion in “actual damages” and another $300 billion in “exemplary damages,” court records show ADVERTISEMENTAttorney John Flood said “the jury sent a very loud message that if alcohol providers trade money for the safety of their patrons and the public, there must be accountability.”LifestyleCalifornia pushes composting to lower food waste emissionsInterfaith coalition urges Louis Vuitton to shed fur itemsFrom grime to crumbling masonry, US parks get a makeoverMetropolitan Museum of Art cuts Sackler name amid opioid ireA lawyer for Beer Belly’s and its owner, Jovani Castillo, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
