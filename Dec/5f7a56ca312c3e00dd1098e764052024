Fears of a default have rattled financial markets, but economists say the ruling Communist Party wants to avoid sending the wrong signal at a time when it is trying to force companies to cut high debt burdens.“The short-term risks of individual real estate companies will not affect the normal financing function of the medium- and long-term market,” Yi said, according to a transcript released by the central bank.“Evergrande’s hazard is a market event that will be properly handled in accordance with market principles and law,” Yi said. Investors’ interests “will be protected in accordance with the law,” he said.ADVERTISEMENTDefault is all but certain after Evergrande, the global real estate industry’s most indebted company, warned Friday it might run out of cash.
