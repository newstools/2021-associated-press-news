BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — The City Council in Burlington has voted to start a new search for a city police chief. Progressive city councilors offered the resolution during Monday night’s meeting. It passed after midnight, on Tuesday, WCAX-TV reported. Mayor Miro Weinberger last month asked the council to hire a search firm, increase the chief’s pay and give the chief disciplinary power.He said he would move forward with the two candidates who have applied for the job, including current acting Chief Jon Murad, if the council did not act. The resolution that passed included hiring a search firm, but did not satisfy all of the mayor’s requests. “Without the Council commitment to raising the salary cap, hiring a PIO and recruiter, or to retaining (the) Police Chief’s leadership over discipline, this action does not give the Administration what it needs to successfully re-start the search process,” Weinberger said in a written statement on Tuesday.
