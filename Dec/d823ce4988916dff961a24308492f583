BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Goals from Barcelona’s latest teenage talents weren’t enough to save Xavi Hernández’s side from another letdown Sunday after a late strike gave Osasuna a 2-2 draw in the Spanish league.Barcelona was leading 2-1 after 19-year-olds Nico González and Abde Ezzalzouli scored their first goals since joining the team from the club’s youth squads this season.But Osasuna substitute Chimy Ávila struck from long range, with the ball deflecting off a Barcelona defender before going in, to pull the hosts level with four minutes to go.Nico and Abde form part of a group of young players, along with Pedri González and Gavi Páez. The group is providing the only bright side to a dismal campaign for Barcelona.“Luckily we have our young players because they are holding the team up. They are making an extraordinary effort,” Xavi said. “We have to keep growing, but it is going to be difficult to get out of this rut. We need a favorable result. We had this victory and let it get away.”Barcelona has only won once on the road in the league this season, following the exit of Lionel Messi.
