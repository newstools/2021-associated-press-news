LAKE CHARLES, La. (AP) — Attracting and retaining employees has become a priority amid the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the Lake Charles City Council debated for over an hour Wednesday before approving a 3% pay raise across the board to all city employees and included an adjustment to the pay plan which brings minimum wage from $10 an hour to $10.75 an hour, KPLC-TV  reported.Mayor Nic Hunter’s administration said there is currently a 17% vacancy in the water department, 9% in the fire department and 15% in the police department with 32 positions to fill.“If in 2019, I had a crystal ball and I could show you that COVID was coming and that the hurricanes were coming, and the floods were coming, and the storms were coming - would you have made changes then to better prepare the city?” police recruiter Larry Moss asked during the meeting. “Of course you would. Well I don’t have a crystal ball about storms, don’t know anything about COVID, I know a lot about recruiting and there is a storm coming.”ADVERTISEMENTCouncilman Mark Eckard said he believed the pay raise for police should be double what was proposed. Nearly 600 bullet casings were recovered from crime scenes last year and this year, more than 400 were found, he said. He described the city as a “war zone” and believes the police department needs increased pay to assist in their recruiting. The administration plans to meet with the police union to discuss the pay issue in more detail before the February 2022 council meeting.
