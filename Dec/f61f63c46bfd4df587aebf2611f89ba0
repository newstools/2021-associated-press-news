He leads all rookie quarterbacks with 3,168 passing yards and 18 touchdowns. He needs two TDs to become the 15th rookie quarterback to reach 3,000 yards passing and 20 touchdowns. KEY MATCHUP: Jones vs. Buffalo’s secondary. The rookie is coming off a rough outing against the Colts in which he had a pair of bad interceptions and completed 58% of his passes, his second-worst completion percentage of the season. He got away with throwing only three passes in the first outing against Buffalo because of windy and wet conditions, but will likely need to do more this time against the NFL’s top-ranked pass defense. KEY INJURIES: Bills WR Beasley won’t play and Sanders’ status is uncertain after missing last week with a knee injury. It’s unclear if starting LT Dion Dawkins and starting RG Jon Feliciano can be cleared off COVID-19 list in time to play. … Patriots RB Damien Harris sat out last week’s loss to Indianapolis with a hamstring injury and was limited to begin the week of practice, along with rookie RB Rhamondre Stevenson (illness). WR Kendrick Bourne was one of four Patriots who entered the week on the COVID-19 list, along with LBs Harvey Langhi, Cameron McGrone and Ronnie Perkins. Bourne leads the team with 45 receptions and 667 receiving yards. He tops all Patriots receivers with five TD catches.

New England is 39-22 overall at home against Buffalo, including a 16-3 record at Gillette Stadium. The Patriots will be trying for their 28th series sweep overall and 16th under Bill Belichick.STATS AND STUFF: New England clinches the AFC East with a win plus a Miami loss or tie at New Orleans. There are also multiple combinations in which a Patriots win and losses by the Raiders, Colts, Chargers, Bengals or Ravens would clinch a playoff berth for New England. … If the Bills win, they’d be back in first place in the division, hold tiebreakers over the Patriots and Dolphins and be in the driver’s seat to win their second straight title. … With three TDs passing last weekend, QB Josh Allen increased his season total to 31 in becoming Buffalo’s first player with 30 or more TDs passing in consecutive seasons. ...

Jackson is second in the NFL with seven interceptions behind Dallas’ Trevon Diggs (10). … K Nick Folk leads the NFL with a career-high 34 made field goals.
