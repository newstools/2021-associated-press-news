PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A 28-year-old giraffe, one of the longest known to live in captivity in the U.S., died on Wednesday in Providence, Rhode Island.The Roger Williams Park Zoo said the female Masai giraffe, Sukari, had age-related ailments including arthritis. The husbandry, animal care and veterinary teams decided to euthanize her after determining that they were no longer keeping her comfortable, the Providence Journal reported. “In addition to exploring therapeutic options, we also made behavioral and environmental changes, but she didn’t respond as we had hoped. Sukari reached an age that is rare in the giraffe world, and we are glad that she was able to spend her senior years here contentedly until now,” said Jessica Lovstad, a clinical veterinarian at the zoo, in a statement. ADVERTISEMENTThe zoo said she was one of the oldest Masai giraffes in the country and that females of the species in captivity typically live 20 years. Sukari was born at the Los Angeles Zoo on Feb. 27, 1993 and came to the zoo in Providence when she was 9 months old. She gave birth to Jaffa, a male giraffe who remains at the zoo.
