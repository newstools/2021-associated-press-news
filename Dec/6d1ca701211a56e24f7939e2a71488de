PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota airport officials are working on their plans to spend an estimated $16.4 million in federal infrastructure funding. Airport managers can submit their projects to the Federal Aviation Administration for review in the coming weeks. The FAA is encouraging airports to prioritize projects that increase safety and sustainability. The agency plans to reach out to minority business owners on opportunities available as a result of the funding. South Dakota’s 54 airports will receive some funding made available by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed by President Joe Biden last month. The money can be used to improve runways, taxiways, terminals and airport-transit connections and roads. It’s the first of five annual rounds of funding South Dakota airports will receive. The state’s commercial airports in Aberdeen, Sioux Falls, Pierre, Rapid City and Watertown will receive nearly $10 million in first-year funding. The money comes from the Airport Infrastructure Grant program, one of three aviation programs created by the new law, which provides $15 billion over five years.  An additional 49 smaller airports across South Dakota will also receive funding during the first year.
