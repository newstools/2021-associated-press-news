HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The number of children under the care of Connecticut’s child welfare agency trails the number children statewide when it comes to getting vaccinated for COVID-19, according to recently released figures.While 30% of children ages five to 11 across Connecticut have received at least one dose of the vaccine, 3.5% of children in the care of the state Department of Children and Families who are in the same age group have received at least one dose, the Hartford Courant reported  on Friday.“It’s alarming, when the recommendations from the leading health professionals in the world are to be vaccinated, that so many children are not,” Sarah Eagan, the state’s child advocate, told the Courant, referring to the state agency’s data as of Dec. 16.ADVERTISEMENTA total of about 800 children, ages 5 to 23, in DCF care had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Dec. 16. That represents 38% of the roughly 2,200 children who are eligible for the vaccine, according to the agency data.
