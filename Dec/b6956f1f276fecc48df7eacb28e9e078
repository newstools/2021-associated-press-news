A bodyguard of the two mayors was wounded and a driver who came to pick them up was killed, police said.Investigators were trying to identify the two gunmen and two companions who escaped on motorcycles and determine their motive, including the possibility that it involved a political rivalry.The two mayors were reportedly running in May 9 elections.
