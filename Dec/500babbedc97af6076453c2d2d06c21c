Among those on the assistant coaches committee are Pro Football Hall of Fame coaches Tony Dungy and Bill Cowher, former NFL coach and general manager Mike Holmgren, and former offensive coordinators Jimmy Raye and Terry Robiskie.ADVERTISEMENT“We are very excited to put a spotlight on these important professions within the game,” said Saleem Choudhry, Vice President of Museum/Exhibit Services. “There are hundreds of individuals who have made professional football the most popular sport in the United States.
