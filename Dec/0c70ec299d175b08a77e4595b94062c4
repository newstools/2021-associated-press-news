NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic isn’t stopping Nashville from hosting its annual New Year’s Eve bash, but it has wrought some last minute changes to the concert lineup. The Nashville Convention and Visitors Corporation, which is organizing the New Year’s Eve show airing live on CBS and Paramount+, said in a statement that Sam Hunt, the Zac Brown Band and Elle King will not be performing Friday night.“Despite taking precautions, I’ve tested positive for COVID-19,” Zac Brown wrote on Twitter. “While we were very excited to join the incredible line up ... our #1 priority is the safey and well-being of our fans, band, crew and venue staff.”Neither Hunt nor King immediately released a statement explaining their absences.The celebration features performances at a dozen downtown Nashville locations. Brown, Hunt and King had been scheduled to perform on the main stage at Nashville’s Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park. The band Lady A, which had been scheduled to play a different stage, will join Dierks Bentley as the show’s headlining acts.
