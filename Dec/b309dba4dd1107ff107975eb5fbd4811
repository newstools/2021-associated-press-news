COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The outgoing mayor of Columbia, South Carolina has been awarded a Harvard fellowship to mentor and teach students. Steve Benjamin’s office announced Monday he will teach a course in health policy and leadership at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health during the spring 2022 term. The class will study approaches to issues including the COVID-19 pandemic, gun violence, climate resilience, and racial justice. Benjamin, one of the state’s highest-profile Democrats, has served as the first Black mayor of South Carolina’s capital city since 2010. He said earlier this year that he wasn’t seeking a fourth term in office.
