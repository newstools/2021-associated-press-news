BERLIN (AP) — Hertha Berlin finally delivered the performance its long-suffering fans were waiting for by coming from behind to beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in the Bundesliga on Saturday.Former Bayern Munich youth player Marco Richter scored twice to give Hertha fans an early Christmas present and do his old team a favor. Bayern was left nine points clear at the top at the halfway stage, the league’s winter break.Just, there were few fans in Berlin’s Olympiastadion to see it. Capacity was capped at 5,000 due to restrictions against the coronavirus. Hertha’s players celebrated with those lucky enough to attend, while Mariah Carey singing “Merry Christmas” blasted around the mostly empty 74,000-capacity stadium.It was arguably Hertha’s best performance of the season, and it gave new coach Tayfun Korkut his second win from four games in charge since taking over from the fired Pál Dárdai. Korkut’s players were clearly keen on atoning for Tuesday’s lackluster showing in the 4-0 loss in Mainz.“The guys showed heart and played with courage,” Hertha sporting director Fredi Bobic said.ADVERTISEMENTMyziane Maolida had the home fans celebrating early when he guided Peter Pekarik’s cross inside the far post.

Steffen Tigges pulled one back with a header to Raphael Guerreiro’s cross in the 83rd, but Hertha managed to hold on.LEIPZIG LOSESLeipzig’s hopes of a fresh start under a new coach are fading after losing at home to 10-man Arminia Bielefeld 2-0.Japanese midfielder Masaya Okugawa scored the visitors’ second goal in the 75th minute, not long after Fabian Klos was sent off for a bad challenge on Leipzig defender Willi Orban.Janni Serra put Bielefeld in front from a rebound in the 57th, and Leipzig was unable to make its undoubted attacking prowess count.It was the first loss in three games for new Leipzig coach Domenico Tedesco, who took over this month after the club dismissed Jesse Marsch.GLADBACH BLOWS LEADHoffenheim defender Kevin Akpoguma scored in injury time to deny Gladbach its first win after a run of four defeats.
