PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A major theater in Rhode Island has cancelled its performances of “A Christmas Carol” this weekend because a cast member is dealing with COVID-19 symptoms. The Trinity Repertory Company made the announcement on its Facebook page about half an hour before Saturday’s matinee show.The Providence theater said the unnamed cast member reported feeling sick at home Saturday morning, and the afternoon performance had to be scrubbed because there wasn’t an understudy who could take on the role. The theater said it was cancelling the rest of the weekend’s performances out of an abundance of caution.Officials apologized for the abrupt change and said ticket holders will receive a full refund and complimentary access to an online streaming version of the production.“While we never make the decision to cancel a show lightly, our commitment to the health and safety of our artists, staff, and audiences are extremely important to us and made this decision clear,” the theater said in a statement.“A Christmas Carol” runs through Jan. 2 at Trinity Rep. The online streaming version is available until Jan. 16.
