NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The government of Cyprus expects tourism to start fully rebounding in 2022 after arrivals this year increased a healthy 175% over a dismal 2020, a tourism minister said Thursday.Deputy Minister of Tourism Savvas Perdios said the Mediterranean island nation recorded around 1.7 million traveler arrivals between January and October, 54% fewer than in a record-setting 2019.But unlike other years, arrivals noticeably increased this fall instead of dropping off in September, Perdios said. He said tourism is expected to return to pre-pandemic levels by 2024.Tourism directly accounts for 13% of Cyprus’ economy and the precipitous drop in revenue during the first months of the pandemic hit the country hard.Tourism revenue between January and September of this year reached over 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), more than three times the amount for the same period last year but a 53% drop from 2019.ADVERTISEMENTThe decision by Royal Caribbean, the world’s second-largest cruise line operator, to use Cyprus as a home port significantly helped the tourism this year, according to Perdios. The company is expected to keep Cyprus as a home port for the next few years.
