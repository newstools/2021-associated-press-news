SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico public schools have not recovered from the 4% drop in enrollment during the coronavirus pandemic despite the return to in-person schooling.The state had already seen enrollment decline around 1% following years of fewer births and an aging population. The closure of school doors last year accelerated the decline, as many families opted to homeschool instead of attending virtual schools.Public school enrollment from pre-K through high school stayed virtually flat this year at 318,608, marking a decrease of 13 students compared to last fall, according to data released by the education department.In Albuquerque, kindergarten represented the largest drop in enrollment last year, but administrators hoped they’d be back, even at the risk of overflowing classrooms. But there was no rebound. In fact, enrollment is slightly down in all grade levels this year.ADVERTISEMENT“In some cases they’re staying home. Some may be in private schools. And some — we wonder if they’ve left the state,” said Albuquerque Superintendent Scott Elder.Coronavirus pandemicNew UK mask rules start as Johnson under fire over partiesAnti-vaccine group targets California's medical director   UK seeks unity at G7 meeting over Russia's 'malign behavior'Stay French, or not?

This year homeschooling is slightly down, at 10,300.___This version corrects that statewide fall enrollment was 318,608, not 318,621, and that the overall decrease was 13 students, not an increase of 13 students.
