Its scheduled game last week against George Mason was canceled because of COVID-19, and the last thing the Badgers wanted was a nearly three-week layoff before traveling to No. 3 Purdue to resume Big Ten play. They got a scare from Illinois State, but at least they got back on the court.UP NEXTIllinois State: At Valparaiso on Sunday.Wisconsin: At Purdue on Monday.___More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
