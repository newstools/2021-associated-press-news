GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Justin Fields came back after missing two games and spent the first half Sunday building on the momentum he had started to establish before his rib injury.But the final two quarters of a 45-30 loss to the Green Bay Packers revealed how far the Chicago Bears’ rookie quarterback still has to go.Fields went 9 of 16 for 150 yards with two touchdown passes and an interception in the first half to help the Bears (4-9) grab a 27-21 lead, a strong start after he sat out two games with broken ribs.Then came the second half.Fields went 9 of 17 for just 74 yards with an interception and a fumble over the final two periods. The Bears were outscored 24-3 after halftime and didn’t get a first down until less than five minutes remained in the game.The second-half struggles by Fields and Chicago’s defense spoiled a spectacular performance from Jakeem Grant, who scored on a 97-yard punt return and also caught a flip pass from Fields in the backfield and turned it into a 46-yard touchdown.

Fields took a bad angle on his attempt at a tackle and ended up falling to the ground as Douglas reached the end zone.Fields responded with a big play to put Chicago back ahead. On third-and-4 from the Chicago 44, Fields hit Damiere Byrd in stride. Byrd caught the pass around midfield and outran Green Bay’s defense into the end zone.In the third quarter, Fields made another big mistake that helped Green Bay take control for good.Chicago trailed 28-27 when Preston Smith sacked Fields and forced a fumble that Rashan Gary recovered at the Bears’ 23-yard line.
