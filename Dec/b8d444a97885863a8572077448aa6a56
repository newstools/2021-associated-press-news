HONOLULU (AP) — A Hawaii state official on Monday agreed that the Navy should be required to remove fuel from massive fuel tanks it owns near Pearl Harbor, saying they pose “a metaphorical ticking time bombing” threatening the water supply of the state’s most populous island. David Day’s recommendation came in response to the Navy’s appeal of an earlier order from Gov. David Ige to defuel the tanks. Day held two days of hearings last week to consider the facts of the case. “The evidence shows that the Red Hill Facility is simply too old, too poorly designed, too difficult to maintain, too difficult to inspect, along with being too large to prevent future releases,” wrote David D. Day in his recommendation.Department of Health Deputy Director Marian Tsuji will consider Day’s recommendation when making a final decision.The Navy didn’t immediately comment on the substance of Day’s findings.ADVERTISEMENT“We are aware of the proposed decision and have no further statement at this time,” said Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, the Navy’s chief of information. The governor ordered the Navy to remove the fuel after fuel leaked from the the facility last month and contaminated the Navy’s tap water system serving some 93,000 people in and around Pearl Harbor.
