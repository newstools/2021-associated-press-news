They’re from the National Disaster Medical System, with the work funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.Elliot Hospital received a physician, nurse practitioner, nurses and paramedics to help with their 16-bed ICU, which currently has 24 patients. The hospital has moved some of the ICU patients to other floors.The medical personnel are scheduled to remain at Elliot Hospital for two weeks, but that could be extended if the COVID-19 surge continues.A holiday-season spike in cases and hospitalizations has hit even New England, one of the most highly inoculated corners of the country.More than 400 people were in the hospital with COVID-19 in New Hampshire at the start of last week, breaking the record set last winter.Gov. Chris Sununu directed hospitals to set up COVID-19 “surge centers” using space normally reserved for such things as outpatient care.
