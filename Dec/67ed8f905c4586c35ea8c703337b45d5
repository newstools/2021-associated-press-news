TUPELO, Miss. (AP) — A board of supervisors in north Mississippi is requesting that the state Legislature dedicate stretches of highway to a former sheriff and Korean and Vietnam war veterans.Under the proposal, the intersection of Auburn Road and Interstate 22 would memorialize late Lee County sheriff Harold Ray Presley. The proposed designation is the “Harold Ray Presley Memorial Interchange,” The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Presley was shot and killed on July 6, 2001 during a search for a suspected kidnapper, Billy Ray Stone. A tip led Presley and a deputy to a home, where authorities say he was shot multiple times by Stone. Stone was also killed, and two deputies faced federal civil rights charges accusing them of stomping and beating Stone while he was handcuffed. The deputies were acquitted.ADVERTISEMENTNorthern District Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley said the highway designation would be a fitting honor for his uncle, Harold Ray Presley.BusinessFlight cancellations drag on as airlines short-staffedRussian court slaps Google, Meta with massive finesOmicron is latest blow to pandemic-weary front-line workersUS to lift omicron-linked travel ban on southern Africa“He was killed in the line of duty in a pursuit that began at that intersection,” he said.
