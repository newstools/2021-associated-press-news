BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Intensified testing in two Louisiana parishes next to Arkansas has not found any deer with a lethal, slow and highly infectious brain disease, The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries says. A news release said 104 deer shot in Union Parish and 54 shot in Morehouse Parish have been tested since early December, when Arkansas authorities found chronic wasting disease in a deer taken near the state line. The LSU Diagnostic Laboratory has been sent 93 more heads of deer killed in Union Parish and 16 more from Morehouse Parish. The department wants to check 300 deer, and is 30 short of that goal.Arkansas officials said Dec. 2 that the diseased deer was taken in the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge in Union County, less than 8 miles (13 kilometers) north of the Louisiana state line.ADVERTISEMENTChronic wasting disease, or CWD, is spread by malformed proteins called prions, like those that cause mad cow disease and the related human infection called Creutzfelt-Jacob disease.
