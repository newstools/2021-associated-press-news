He tweeted, “The unfortunate incident leading to the killing of civilians at Oting is highly condemnable.”An army officer said the soldiers fired at a truck after receiving intelligence about a movement of insurgents in the area and killed six people. As irate villagers burned two army vehicles, the soldiers fired at them, killing nine more people, the officer said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to talk to reporters. One soldier was also killed in the clash with protesters, he said.ADVERTISEMENTOn Sunday, fresh violence erupted when nearly 200 residents attacked the army camp in Mon district, going on a rampage and setting fire to residential quarters.

Nyamtow Konyak, a local community leader, said those killed were coal miners.India’s Home Minister Amit Shah expressed anguish over the “unfortunate incident” and said the state government will investigate the killings.The army officer said the soldiers had laid an ambush for a week following intelligence that insurgents were planning to attack soldiers in the area, 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Gauhati, the capital of Assam state.
