BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Two northeast Louisiana colleges are working together to try to combat the statewide nursing shortage that has only worsened during the coronavirus pandemic.
KNOE-TV reports that Louisiana Delta Community College and the University of Louisiana at Monroe have reached an agreement to allow nursing students who obtained a two-year degree at any community college in Louisiana to transfer to ULM to pursue a bachelor’s degree in nursing.“We’re going to look back, and this really will have changed the trajectory of the opportunities that we can offer our community,” said Wendi Tostenson, vice chancellor of Louisiana Delta Community College. The program is designed to attract students from every corner of the state. Louisiana Delta Community College Chancellor Randy Esters said the program is flexible to try to encourage more students to participate.“This particular effort puts all the classwork online after they leave the community college,” Dr. Esters told KNOE. “It allows them to work at the bedside while they are taking classes for their nursing degree.”
