NEW YORK (AP) — The prosecution has made its case against Ghislaine Maxwell. Starting Thursday, her defense team takes its turn. Maxwell, a socialite, has denied allegations from multiple women that she helped the millionaire Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Her lawyers say she’s being wrongly targeted by prosecutors on a vendetta to hold someone accountable after Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial on related sex-abuse charges.With just days left in Maxwell’s trial, it’s time to take stock of developments.WHO ARE GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S ACCUSERS?The prosecution, mounted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, hinges on the accusations of four women who say they were teenagers when Maxwell and Epstein sexually exploited them in the 1990s and early 2000s. Three testified under the pseudonyms Jane, Kate and Carolyn. One, Annie Farmer, decided to tell her story publicly. ADVERTISEMENTWHAT WAS GHISLAINE MAXWELL UP TO BEFORE HER ARREST?Maxwell was arrested in July 2020 — almost a year after Epstein killed himself in jail while awaiting trial. After Epstein’s death, she withdrew from public activities like running an oceans charity. Her whereabouts became a subject of public speculation. Was that her eating a burger and reading a book on CIA operatives in Southern California? Was she living in Britain or Paris or maybe even Massachusetts? Prosecutors say she went into hiding in New Hampshire — where she was eventually arrested — in a million-dollar home where she kept her cellphone wrapped in foil.Ghislaine MaxwellWhat's going on with Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial?4 women met Maxwell as teens.

Maxwell has triple citizenship with the U.S., U.K. and France, which does not extradite its citizens. Her attorneys and family have lambasted jail conditions, which they say are punitive and inhospitable to Maxwell’s ability to mount a proper defense.

Not exactly, at least. A woman is suing the British royal, saying he sexually abused her when she was 17. She says Maxwell facilitated her meetings with Andrew, who has denied the account. But the woman’s accusations have been left out  of this trial. That lawsuit  won’t go to trial until at least late 2022.
