BALTIMORE (AP) — More than a week after a cyberattack forced the Maryland Department of Health to take its website offline, several COVID-19 data points remain missing from the department’s website.The daily COVID-19 hospitalization tally has returned, with a dramatic increase in volume since the website stopped reporting other surveillance numbers, including a daily case count, death toll, testing volume and positivity rate, The Baltimore Sun reported. Hospital bed occupancy has spiked nearly 45% since Dec. 3, according to state data.Gov. Larry Hogan has said data hasn’t been compromised. However, the data remained incomplete Monday and officials didn’t say why metrics remained outdated or when they might return.“Restoring our full COVID-19 data reporting capabilities after the recent network security incident is one of the Maryland Department of Health’s top priorities,” spokesman Andy Owen said in an email on Monday.
