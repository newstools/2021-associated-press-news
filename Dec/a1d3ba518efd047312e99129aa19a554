TROY, N.Y. (AP) — A man who represented himself at trial was convicted of murdering four people, including two children, in an apartment in Troy in 2017. Jurors deliberated for just hours before finding James White, 42, guilty on 16 counts on Wednesday, the Times Union reported. White and another man, Justin Mann, were both initially charged in the deaths of Brandi Mells, 22, Shanta Myers, 36, and Myers’ two children: Jeremiah, 11, and 5-year-old Shanise.Prosecutors said the two men stabbed all four in the neck after going to the home to collect $12 allegedly owed to a relative. They also took a television and an Xbox video game system, prosecutors said. The bodies of the four people were not found until several days later, the newspaper reported. ADVERTISEMENTMann pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and appeared as a witness for the prosecution, meaning that White cross-examined him directly in this trial. White claimed that he waited outside as Mann killed the four people and insisted he was innocent in his closing argument, the newspaper reported.Coronavirus pandemicUS expands Pfizer COVID boosters, opens extra dose to age 16Vaccine makers racing to update COVID shots, just in caseFor NYC businesses, vaccine mandates put damper on holidayHow will the world decide when the pandemic is over?A juror on the trial, Halbert Copeland, 61, told the newspaper he did not find White’s story believable.“He was a manipulator and a liar and that was so evident,” Copeland said.A judge declared a mistrial in a previous trial for White because of the coronavirus pandemic.
