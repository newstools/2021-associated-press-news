HOUMA, La. (AP) — Days before Christmas someone stole the seat to the bicycle that a 26-year-old man used to get to and from work in all sorts of weather. A community fundraiser to replace the bike brought quickly expanded, and Houma residents gave Chris Bergeron his first car on Thursday, WWL-TV reported.Bergeron works the night shift at Mr. Ronnie’s Famous Hot Donuts in Houma, more than 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) from his home. His bicycle seat was stolen while he was working Monday. Company co-owner Kellen Picou, who describes Bergeron as one of the best people he’s ever hired, posted blurry security video online, hoping to identify the thief.“I don’t ever remember him calling in sick,” said Picou. “Any time he was ever late it was usually due to weather.” ADVERTISEMENTColleen Chiasson saw Picou’s message and began raising money for a new bike but quickly changed goals. “I just had this overwhelming feeling that I could do better, so I said, ‘You know what, I’m going to buy a car,’” she said.

Bergeron walked to work when Picou hired him three years ago, then bought a bike. “I’ve pretty much had to walk and ride my bike everywhere even from since childhood because my dad’s always been busy, my mom has always been working,” said Bergeron. “I’m just used to it.” The car will make life much easier, he said. “It’s not going to be as hectic trying to find a way to and from and if the weather is bad, I don’t have to worry about it,” said Bergeron. “It’s really, really heartwarming and not at all anything I would have expected.”
