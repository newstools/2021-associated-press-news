Former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire has been elected chair of the BAE Systems, Inc., board of directors for a three-year term. Ayotte was appointed to the board of the defense manufacturer in June 2017. During her term in the U.S. Senate from 2011-2017, she was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Ayotte’s “substantial experience in national defense and security have helped guide our work to support our customers’ most critical missions,” Tom Arseneault, president and CEO of BAE Systems, said in a news release Monday. “We look forward to the leadership and stewardship she will provide in this expanded role as Chair of our Board.” Ayotte succeeds former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, who has served as chair since April 2012.
