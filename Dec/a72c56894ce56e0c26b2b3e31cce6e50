DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Freshman Shayeann Day-Wilson scored 19 points to help Duke beat No. 9 Iowa 79-64 on Wednesday night in the Hawkeyes’ return from a COVID-19 pause that led to the cancellation of three games.Celeste Taylor added 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Blue Devils, who didn’t trail after midway through the first quarter in this Big Ten/ACC Challenge matchup. Duke shot 44% and won despite shooting 6 of 21 from 3-point range, but controlled the glass for a 45-35 advantage with a physical edge inside.Duke (7-0) led by eight at halftime then held Iowa to 1-of-12 shooting out of the break to push that margin to 18 points, securing the first win for second-year coach Kara Lawson against a ranked opponent.Star guard Caitlin Clark scored 22 points for the Hawkeyes (4-1), with most of her production coming on a brutal shooting night after Duke had built its big lead. Monika Czinano had 21 points while providing a reliable post presence, but Iowa’s outside shooters offered little balance by missing 16 of 19 3-pointers.ADVERTISEMENTClark, a preseason Associated Press All-American who entered averaging 21.5 points, shot 9 of 27 from the field and 1 of 13 from 3-point range. Clark also exited the game for a sequence in the fourth quarter after hobbling on her right leg, though she quickly re-entered after a trainer massaged around her knee at the end of the bench.The Hawkeyes hadn’t played since beating Southern on Nov. 17. Three games were canceled, first a home matchup with Drake followed by dates with Seton Hall and USC in the Cancun Challenge in Mexico.BIG PICTUREIowa: Coach Lisa Bluder had said the pause had cost the team “really good preparation” time for a six-game month that includes two Big Ten games. She was most concerned about details like how the interruption would impact timing on passes and cuts. Iowa got a quick start by feeding Czinano in the paint for a 6-0 lead, but the Hawkeyes could hit nothing reliably outside as Duke kept stretching its lead. Iowa got no closer than 11 points in the fourth quarter.Duke: The Blue Devils were playing their second game against a ranked opponent under Lawson, whose debut season amid the pandemic lasted just four games when the program opted out of the rest of the season at Christmas last year. Now they have their first 7-0 start since opening the 2013-14 season at 10-0, with much of their success coming from their rebounding work (including 16-10 on the offensive glass).UP NEXTIowa: The Hawkeyes host Michigan State on Sunday in their Big Ten opener.Duke: The Blue Devils visit Penn on Sunday, then have an extended break before facing top-ranked South Carolina on Dec. 15.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at https://twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
