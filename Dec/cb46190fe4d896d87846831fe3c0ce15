The race director initially said lapped drivers could not pass the safety car, then reversed the call in a decision that returned Verstappen to second when the race resumed with a lap remaining.ADVERTISEMENTVerstappen then passed Hamilton to win his first world championship; Hamilton was denied a record eighth title and remained tied with Michael Schumacher.SportsAP sources: NHL to withdraw from Olympics after COVID surgeTyreek Hill among 21 NFL players added to COVID-19 listNFL could become trend-setter for COVID-19 testing policiesJalen Hurts has 3 TDs, Eagles come back to beat WashingtonMercedes immediately protested but last week withdrew its appeal.Latifi had apologized earlier for playing such a huge role in the Dec. 12 race but said Tuesday that he’ll always compete hard until the checkered flag, no matter what position he is in.“To the people who don’t understand or don’t agree with that, that’s fine with me. You can have your opinion. But to use those opinions to fuel hatred, abuse and threats of violence, not only to me, but to those closest to me as well, tells me these people are not true fans of the sport,” he wrote.___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
