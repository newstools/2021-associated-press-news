About 300 police and other security personnel were sent to the facility as the destruction escalated.Three inmates who tried to climb over the prison wall were injured with rubber bullets. No deaths have been reported. Following negotiations overnight, provincial Gov. Puthipong Sirimat agreed to immediately send 14 inmates with severe COVID-19 symptoms for treatment.ADVERTISEMENTPuthipong told reporters after calm was restored Friday that provincial heath staff provided ATK tests for some of the inmates and found around 200 were infected. Female inmates were being sent to other prisons in an attempt to ease overcrowding at the facility, which houses more than 2,000 people.Coronavirus infection has hit Thailand’s 300,000-strong prison population hard.
