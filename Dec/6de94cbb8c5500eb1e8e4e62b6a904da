But it was the network’s most-watched program. With stars like Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Hart, John Lithgow, Jon Stewart and Snoop Dogg, the annual exercise hosted by Jimmy Kimmel got some good word-of-mouth.Otherwise, it was a fairly typical week in television, with football dominating and CBS’ “60 Minutes” the top non-sports broadcast.CBS eked out a weekly win, averaging 5.94 million viewers in prime time to NBC’s 5.89 million.
