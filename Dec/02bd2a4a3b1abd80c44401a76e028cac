NEW YORK (AP) — It has the makings of a blue Christmas for Leah. She’s turning 30 on Christmas Eve, the same day she’ll be a bridesmaid at her brother’s wedding.But wait — her childhood crush is back in town. Sounds like a movie premise guaranteed to tug at heartstrings, and no one knows how to do that this time of year like the Hallmark Channel.That movie with Emily Osment in the starring role, “A Very Merry Bridesmaid,” and another premiere last weekend, “Sister Swap: Hometown Holidays,” are part of an assembly line of holiday fare at Hallmark. Both reached nearly 3 million viewers, the Nielsen company said.Hallmark was the most-watched entertainment cable channel last week, as it often is as the holidays approach. The network scores particularly well among its target audience of women ages 25-to-54.Broadcast networks are rolling out their own holiday fare, with NBC’s special surrounding the Christmas tree lighting in Rockefeller Center the most popular last week.ADVERTISEMENTNBC reached 5.3 million people for its live production of “Annie!” Live television musicals are losing their pull ever since becoming a semi-regular feature when a production of “The Sound of Music” surprised people by drawing more than 18 million viewers in 2013. “Annie! Live” did beat ABC’s interview with Alec Baldwin on the “Rust” movie set shooting, which was a direct competitor.Alec BaldwinHallmark takes familiar holiday role; NFL leads prime time2021's notable moments on TV: Capitol riot, 'Rust,' ShatnerBaldwin: 'Someone is responsible' for shooting, but 'not me'Baldwin to ABC about shooting: 'I didn't pull the trigger'Meanwhile, Fox rode football to a win in the weekly ratings, averaging 6.4 million viewers in prime time last week.
