A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Tuesday:ENGLANDPep Guardiola is expecting another difficult game against a Leeds side that took four points off Manchester City last season. City went on to win the title and has a one-point lead in the standings over Liverpool approaching the midway point. “Leeds are one of our toughest opponents,” Guardiola said. “We have to adjust a few things because it is different to other opponents. We are not much used to these type of games.” But Leeds is 15th in the 20-team standings and with a lengthy injury list. Across in east England, last-placed Norwich’s manager, Dean Smith, comes up against Aston Villa, which fired him last month. Steven Gerrard’s Villa has been hit by a coronavirus outbreak but its game is not in doubt. But COVID-19 infections at Manchester United could see its game at Brentford postponed. United didn’t travel to London as planned on Monday.ADVERTISEMENTGERMANYBayern Munich can extend its lead at the top of the Bundesliga with a win over Stuttgart. Jamal Musiala scored the winning goal in Bayern’s 2-1 win over Mainz on Saturday, but the 18-year-old attacking midfielder is an injury doubt with a broken bone in his hand. Leon Goretzka is also doubtful and Joshua Kimmich is out with lung damage after a coronavirus infection. Wolfsburg has lost five consecutive games ahead of hosting inconsistent Cologne. Promoted Bochum is on a high after a hard-fought draw with local rival Borussia Dortmund and now plays Arminia Bielefeld. Mainz hosts Hertha Berlin.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
