ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) — Cornell has moved final exams online and sent the campus into high alert a day after finding suspected cases of the new omicron variant in “a very high percentage” of spiking COVID-19 cases, the university announced Tuesday.The upstate New York university said 272 students tested positive for the virus on the 24,000-student campus Monday.Its COVID-19 dashboard reported 903 new student cases over the past week, more than 700 of them detected since Saturday during a post-Thanksgiving spike among vaccinated students.The seven-day positivity rate was 4.2%, according to the dashboard.Cornell’s testing identified a substantial number of samples that contained indicators of the omicron variant, officials said. The university is awaiting confirmation from a lab.“Cornell’s extensive surveillance testing (Monday) uncovered the likely early and rapid spread of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 among our student population,” Joel Malina, vice president for university relations, said in a statement. “While preliminary, initial screening results indicate that the variant now accounts for a very high percentage of our positive COVID-19 cases.”Coronavirus pandemicData indicate omicron is milder, better at evading vaccinesOmicron spreading so fast it threatens Britain's hospitalsPfizer confirms COVID pill's results, potency versus omicronS.

In the United States and many other nations, the delta variant is currently responsible for most COVID-19 cases.With only days remaining in the semester, Cornell President Martha Pollack moved the campus to high-alert status in an attempt to limit spread. Libraries and fitness centers were closed, sports were canceled and students were encouraged to remain in Ithaca until receiving a negative COVID-19 test. The campus is scheduled to close for winter break at the end of the week.“It is obviously extremely dispiriting to have to take these steps,” Pollack said. “However, since the start of the pandemic, our commitment has been to follow the science and do all we can to protect the health of our faculty, staff, and students.”Cornell has required regular surveillance testing for unvaccinated students since the start of the academic year, and weekly testing for vaccinated students.
