MEMPHIS, Tenn.

The Grizzlies have won eight of their last nine.Tyrese Maxey led the Sixers with 23 points, and Charles Bassey added 13. Shake Milton and Tobias Harris ended up with 12 points each as Philadelphia played without center Joel Embiid, a late scratch with right rib soreness.Part of Philadelphia’s problems were from 3-point range, where it went 4 for 22. Memphis led by 12 points at the half and stretched the advantage to 82-60 with a 14-4 run to open the third quarter. That was only the start: Memphis was up 101-75 entering the fourth, in part because of Jackson’s 13 third-quarter points, and because the Sixers turned the ball over six times in the quarter. ADVERTISEMENTBy that point, Sixers coach Doc Rivers let his reserves close out the game. Memphis’ lead got up to as many as 36 in the fourth.Both teams shot well in the first half, the Sixers at a 53% clip and Memphis just under 57%.
