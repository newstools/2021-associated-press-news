Ramsey’s versatility covers gaps in the Rams’ spotty pass defense and frees up their pass rushers. Ramsey is their second-leading tackler, and his three interceptions are one shy of his career high. The Rams are a much better team with Ramsey on the field, and he is fairly well-rested heading to Minnesota.Coronavirus pandemicEXPLAINER: What to do if you test positive for COVID-19Pfizer pill becomes 1st US-authorized home COVID treatmentNYC adds testing; no decision on Times Square New Year's EveFrench kids line up to get vaccine shots as omicron spreadsADVERTISEMENTVIKINGS PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Kirk Cousins is just 26 for 55 (47.3%) in the last two games, both Vikings wins, with half of his season interception total (six). The pass rush, particularly inside, by the Bears threw Cousins off and he can expect more of the same from Rams star DT Aaron Donald. Cousins is still second in the NFL this year in interception percentage, third in sack percentage, fourth in passer rating, seventh in passing yards and seventh in passing touchdowns this year.KEY MATCHUP: Vikings DBs vs. Rams WR Cooper Kupp. With Kupp frequently in the slot, nickel CB Mackensie Alexander will be have a heavy responsibility to keep the NFL’s leading receiver in relative check. Kupp will line up all over, including in the backfield, so the entire secondary will have to be on high alert for the fifth-year star who has already set the single-season franchise record for receptions (122). Kupp has 388 yards and four TDs in the last three games.
