Three women who were bystanders suffered non-life-threatening wounds to their legs or feet and a fourth woman broke her ankle while fleeing, said police.“This is just a very unfortunate incident that is completely out of character for our area,” Kruger said.ADVERTISEMENTThe outdoor mall is a major shopping destination about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Chicago.Around 100 police officers, including SWAT teams, rushed to the mall and went store to store in search of the other shooter, Kruger said.LifestyleCOVID-19 makes Biden's 1st White House Christmas less merryYes, there is a Santa Claus.
