JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Amid fast-increasing new COVID-19 infections, South African officials on Thursday urged people to get vaccinated before traveling for the holidays and attending festive gatherings.South Africa’s daily new confirmed cases climbed to more than 26,900 on Wednesday and 24,700 on Thursday, the highest yet in the new wave driven by the omicron variant — and reaching the peak of an earlier surge in June and July caused by delta.South Africa’s 7-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen steeply over the past two weeks from 6.4 new cases per 100,000 people on Dec. 1 to 38.5 new cases per 100,000 people on Dec. 15, according to Johns Hopkins University. The rate of deaths has not increased over the same period, but health experts warn that fatalities can lag a few weeks after new cases.The omicron variant is driving the current surge, as it’s responsible for more than 90% of the new daily cases, scientists say, citing tests. ADVERTISEMENTThe new cases are increasing in almost all of South Africa’s nine provinces, after previously being concentrated in Gauteng province, which includes the largest city, Johannesburg, and the capital Pretoria.
