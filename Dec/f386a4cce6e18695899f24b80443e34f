Reaction from social media and elsewhere to the death of Hall of Fame coach and broadcaster John Madden:___“We worked together for seven years on ‘Monday Night Football’ and ‘Sunday Night Football.’ It was like hitting the lottery. He was so much more than just football — a keen observer of everything around him and a man who could carry on a smart conversation about hundreds and hundreds of topics.

A dear friend, a wonderful partner in the broadcast booth and a man who brought so much joy to so many people, I’ll miss him enormously.” — Al Michaels, lead announcer for NBC’s “Sunday Night Football.”___“In the 150+ years football’s been around, no one has had a bigger impact on the game than John Madden.
