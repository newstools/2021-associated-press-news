HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The increase in COVID-19 cases has derailed the traditional holiday open house at the Connecticut governor’s historic residence.Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Wednesday that he and his wife Annie “made the difficult decision to not hold the event in-person” and instead make the 31st annual open house at the 1909 Georgian Revival style home a virtual event.The event was canceled last year as well, prompting the couple to release their first video tour. “I love the Christmas season, and every year I look forward to sharing in the festivities with everyone. That is why it pains me that we can’t all gather together in-person again, but it is the safe and right thing to do,” Lamont said in a statement.Lamont appears in this year’s video, distributed on his various social media accounts, with a small group of children who live in the Hartford area. He shows them around the residence, which has been decorated with donated trees, wreaths and plants from Connecticut growers. Originally built for a Hartford physician and industrialist, the home has served as the official residence of the Connecticut governor since 1943.
