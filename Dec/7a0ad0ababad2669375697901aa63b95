Kamara was held to 5 yards rushing on eight carries and had four receptions for 25 yards in the last meeting. But Kamara remains the Saints’ best offensive player and the Carolina defense has struggled mightily in the second half of the season.

KEY INJURIES: The Panthers will be without starting cornerback Stephon Gilmore (groin), the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year in 2019 with the New England Patriots. It’s expected rookie Keith Taylor will start at cornerback alongside C.J. Henderson. Saints FS Marcus Willaims has been placed on the club’s COVID-19 reserve list this week but more than 10 players have returned from that list to the active roster this week, including QB Taysom Hill and LB Demario Davis.
