BRANDON, Vt. (AP) — The town of Brandon is holding its second annual reverse Christmas parade on Sunday. Organizers say houses along certain streets have been decorated so that people can drive by and take in the sights. “Almost all of Park Street is decorated,” Colleen Wright, the town’s assistant recreation director told the Rutland Herald. “They’ve really gone overboard this year, and I love it. And we have a lot of houses up on Mount Pleasant, we have a lot of houses on Pearl Street and Carver Street. Brandon is just glowing.”She expects this year people will also decorate their cars. The parade was started last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Before it was, like, we’d have a couple hundred kids and their families at the Legion, but now everybody can do the reverse parade and it’s super fun because people can put their kids in the car seats in their pajamas, and they go see all the lights and have a fun time,” Wright said. The reverse parade takes place from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. The route s up High Street, down Park Street, through Center Park Walk, and north onto Route 7, Wright said.
