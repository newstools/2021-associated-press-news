CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Blackhawks forward Jujhar Khaira spent the night in a hospital after he was leveled by Jacob Trouba during a 6-2 loss to the New York Rangers.Team physician Michael Terry said Khaira was released Wednesday morning after undergoing “extensive testing.”“Despite the significant injury, his prognosis is excellent, and we expect a full recovery,” Terry said in a news release. “At this point, it is too early to put a timeline on return to play.”Khaira’s head was down as he gathered the puck in 6:10 into the second period Tuesday night. He looked up right as Trouba appeared to drive his right shoulder into Khaira’s chin.The back of Khaira’s head bounced hard off the ice, and there was no sign of any movement from him as the Blackhawks and Rangers scuffled nearby.A stretcher was wheeled onto the ice, and medical personnel worked on Khaira as each team looked on from the bench area. A handful of his teammates and the Rangers tapped the stretcher as Khaira was taken off.ADVERTISEMENT“Personally I was pretty shaken,” Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews said after the loss. “I’m not going to lie to you. Just glad to hear he’s doing OK.”NHLBlackhawks F Khaira released from hospital after Trouba hitMark Giordano rejoins Kraken after stint in COVID protocolMontreal faces Chicago on 4-game losing streakColorado visits Panarin and the RangersThe 27-year-old Khaira has two goals and no assists in 18 games in his first season with the Blackhawks.
