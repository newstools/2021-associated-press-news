It’s a stunning stretch of futility that has some questioning Lawrence’s long-term viability as a franchise QB. He has completed just two passes longer than 30 yards in that seven-game stretch – he has been plagued by drops and poor offensive line play, too – while throwing five interceptions and taking 17 sacks.NFLLowly Jaguars, Jets square off with top of draft in playSteelers-Chiefs carries significant AFC playoff implicationsSurging Eagles look to continue playoff push vs. GiantsSurging Colts, struggling Cardinals meet on Christmas DayADVERTISEMENTJETS PLAYER TO WATCH: Zach Wilson, taken by New York one spot after Lawrence, has no touchdown passes in his last two games — but also has gone consecutive games without an interception for the first time in what has been an up-and-down rookie season. He has struggled with short throws, in particular, and that has contributed to his NFL-low 56.2 completion percentage. Wilson made progress in that area in his last start, appearing the most comfortable he has been in weeks. KEY MATCHUP: Jets’ defense vs. running back James Robinson. New York has had a tough time stopping anyone on the ground, including last week when Miami’s Duke Johnson ran for a career-high 107 yards. Robinson has run for over 100 yards just once this season. He could get a second Sunday against the Jets.KEY INJURIES: The Jaguars placed S Rayshawn Jenkins (ankle) and backup RB Carlos Hyde (concussion) on IR, ending their seasons. ...
