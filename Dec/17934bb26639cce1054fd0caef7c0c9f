NEW YORK (AP) — CityMD, the chain of urgent care clinics drawing long lines for COVID-19 testing, is temporarily closing 13 locations in New York City, saying it’s doing so “to preserve our ability to staff our sites.”The closures, effective Wednesday, include four clinics in Manhattan and three each in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three locations in New Jersey, two on Long Island and one in Westchester are also closed.Privately run CityMD operates about 150 clinics in New York and New Jersey, providing services including rapid testing, physical exams, X-rays and vaccinations.The company said in a statement that it’s “hopeful any patients affected by temporary closings should still have easy and convenient access” to another location. CityMD isn’t the only option for COVID-19 testing. New York City said it’s expanding to more than 110 city-run testing sites by the end of the week.ADVERTISEMENTCityMD locations have seen lines wrapping around city blocks and wait times of several hours for COVID-19 testing amid a spike in cases driven by the Omicron variant. “It is our hope that closing sites now will best allow us to avoid future closures as this surge continues,” CityMD said.
