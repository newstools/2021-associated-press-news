NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — Gov. Ned Lamont’s office reported Monday that the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Connecticut rose over the weekend to 500, just five months after dropping to a low of 25.That includes a rise of 80 coronavirus-related hospitalizations since Friday, according to the daily metrics released by the governor’s office.It is still well below the high of 1,972 hospitalizations in April of 2020 and the 1,183 hospitalizations reported on Dec. 6, 2020. Lamont, speaking before the latest numbers were released, credited vaccinations and boosters with keeping hospitalizations down.Of the 500 patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19, 386 (77.2%) are not fully vaccinated, according to the governor’s office.“Maybe with each of these variants coming along, we can’t always prevent mild illness,” he said. “But, you’ve got to know that the boosters and the vaccines are keeping you out of the hospital and are keeping you out of the morgue.”The seven-day rolling average of new COVID-19 cases in Connecticut has risen over the past two weeks from about 738 new cases per day on November 20 to just over 971 new cases per day on Dec. 4, according to John’s Hopkins University.
