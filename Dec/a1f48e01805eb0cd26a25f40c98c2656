Mack was suspended for this season’s first six games.Highlights from Bendapudi’s tenure include the university’s 2019 decision to purchase financially ailing Jewish Hospital and several other health care facilities from KentuckyOne Health.

Andy Beshear said: “Not every day that someone pays off their loan 15 years early.”In separate comments regarding Bendapudi’s pending departure, the governor said she had displayed “leadership by example.”“From the successful hospital acquisition, to helping navigate the university and community through COVID-19, even supporting the state through testing and vaccinations, her efforts have been extraordinary,” Beshear said.
