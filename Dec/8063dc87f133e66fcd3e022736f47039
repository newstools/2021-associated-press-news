LAS VEGAS (AP) — The family of a woman who died in a Las Vegas fire two years ago has filed a lawsuit against the companies that maintained the building’s fire alarm system.Six people died in the December 2019 blaze at the Alpine Motel Apartments, which authorities said was the deadliest residential fire in Las Vegas history. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that the family of 59-year-old Tracy Cihal filed the suit Wednesday in District Court against the Alpine’s owners and other companies in charge of safety equipment.Cihal’s family had previously filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the building’s owner.A jury trial in that case is set for October.Court documents state that when the fire broke out, the Alpine’s back door was bolted shut, the fire alarm system was malfunctioning and the building didn’t have a working sprinkler system.According to the Review-Journal, the building constructed in 1972 had gone almost three years without a city fire inspection at the time of the fire. In the aftermath of the Alpine fire, investigators cited more than 40 fire code violations including the sealed rear exit and a faulty fire alarm system.
