He had been invited to teach drawing to the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Pirrie, who owned Oakley House, according to a description on the State Parks’ website. He was at Oakley for about four months, during which he completed or began 32 bird paintings, the site said.The park also features a museum, picnic areas, a nature trail, and a pavilion.
