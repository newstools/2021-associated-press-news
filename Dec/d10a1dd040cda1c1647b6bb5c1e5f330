NEW YORK (AP) — May this be the dayWe come together.Mourning, we come to mend, Withered, we come to weather,Torn, we come to tend,Battered, we come to better. Tethered by this year of yearning,We are learningThat though we weren’t ready for this, We have been readied by it.Steadily we vow that no matterHow we are weighed down,We must always pave a way forward.This hope is our door, our portal.Even if we never get back to normal, Someday we can venture beyond it,To leave the known and take the first steps. So let us not return to what was normal, But reach toward what is next.What was cursed, we will cure.What was plagued, we will prove pure.Where we tend to argue, we will try to agree,Those fortunes we forswore, now the future we foresee, ADVERTISEMENTWhere we weren’t aware, we’re now awake;Those moments we missedAre now these moments we make,The moments we meet,And our hearts, once all together beaten,Now all together beat.Come, look up with kindness yet,EntertainmentAmanda Gorman writes end-of-year poem, 'New Day's Lyric'Review: ‘Jockey’ is a winner for Clifton Collins, Jr. Belgium reverses COVID cultural rules: The show must go on!Trial to open next month in spectacular German jewelry theftFor even solace can be sourced from sorrow. We remember, not just for the sake of yesterday, But to take on tomorrow.We heed this old spirit,In a new day’s lyric,In our hearts, we hear it:For auld lang syne, my dear, For auld lang syne.Be bold, sang Time this year, Be bold, sang Time,For when you honor yesterday, Tomorrow ye will find.Know what we’ve foughtNeed not be forgot nor for none.It defines us, binds us as one, Come over, join this day just begun. For wherever we come together, We will forever overcome.End
