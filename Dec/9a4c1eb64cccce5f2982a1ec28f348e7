CHICAGO (AP) — Washington Capitals forward Nicklas Backstrom is nearing his season debut after being sidelined by a left hip injury.Backstrom skated again Wednesday morning ahead of Washington’s game at Chicago. Coach Peter Laviolette said the veteran center was going to meet with a trainer after the session, but everything looks good.Backstrom, who turned 34 last month, had a team-high 38 assists and 53 points in 55 games last season.“You’re talking about our leading scorer last year, somebody who’s been a mainstay offensively for this organization for a long time,” Laviolette said. “So when you add a player back into the lineup that is skilled like he is and who can make plays like he (can), it’s a benefit.”Defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk and center Nic Dowd also are expected to play against the Blackhawks. Dowd and van Riemsdyk are coming out of the NHL’s COVID-19 protocol.“Those two guys, you know, we’re hoping,” Laviolette said.Laviolette said forward Garnet Hathaway remains in the protocol.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
