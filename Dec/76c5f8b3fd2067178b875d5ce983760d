HENDERSON, Ky.

It is the largest investment in the region in more than 25 years, the statement said.Georgia-based Pratt Industries produces lightweight, high-strength containerboard and corrugated board from recycled paper. The box factory in Kentucky will produce sheet and boxes for distributors and stores with paper from the 650,000-square-foot (60,387-square-meter) mill. Officials say the box factory should be completed by 2023. The Kentucky plant will support a growing logistics and distribution industry, officials said.
