PHOENIX (AP) — JaVale McGee had season highs with 21 points and 15 rebounds, Chris Paul added 12 assists and the Phoenix Suns rolled to a 111-90 win over the Boston Celtics on Friday night.The Suns won for the 20th time in 21 games despite missing starters Devin Booker (hamstring) and Deandre Ayton (non-COVID illness). Booker has missed four games in a row while Ayton was a late scratch because he didn’t feel well at the morning shootaround.McGee picked up the slack, shooting 9 of 16 from the field and even knocking down a 3-pointer, which was just the 11th in his 14-year career. The 7-footer was one of Phoenix’s biggest pickups during free agency, and he’s been very good so far in the desert. The veteran is on pace to average more than 10 points per game for just the fourth time.Seven Suns scored in double figures. Cam Payne had 17 points while Jae Crowder and Cameron Johnson both added 16.ADVERTISEMENTThe Celtics have lost three straight and fell to 13-14. This one was particularly rough.Boston’s offense looked disjointed all night, and nobody could shoot. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 24 points but shot just 10 of 25 from the field. Marcus Smart was 1 of 13. The entire team was 4 of 26 (15%) from 3-point range.NBADurant-led Nets beat Hawks, improve to 8-0 after a lossMcGee scores 21, Suns roll past Celtics 111-90LeBron scores 33, Lakers roll past Thunder 116-95Ingram scores 26, Pelicans extend Pistons' skid to 11 gamesPhoenix took an 84-69 lead after the third quarter and pushed that advantage to 20 points by early in the fourth to cruise to the win.Both teams were missing important players — Boston was without Jaylen Brown (hamstring) and Josh Richardson (COVID-19 protocol) — but the Suns didn’t look bothered by the absences while the Celtics appeared lost.McGee scored 11 points while Landry Shamet and Mikal Bridges both added 10 as Phoenix used a 25-3 run to take a 57-39 lead at the break.
