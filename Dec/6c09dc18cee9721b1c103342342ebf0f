SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A school district in northwestern New Mexico is providing high-speed internet to students’ families, most of whom are Indigenous, in a $1.2 million deal that leapfrogs piecemeal efforts by state and tribal officials.Cuba Independent Schools superintendent Karen Sanchez-Griego said staff began installing Starlink’s $500 receivers at students’ homes in November and hope to connect all 450 families by the end of the school year.Traditional fiber optic cables haven’t been installed around Cuba because of the area’s sparse population, lack of money, and crisscrossing red tape from tribal, federal, and state agencies that have to approve digging.New Mexico education officials were ordered by a court in April to provide high-speed internet to students in Cuba and other areas but haven’t done so. ADVERTISEMENTWi-Fi hotspots from the state didn’t work well in remote areas far from cellphone towers. Education officials are planning on purchasing Starlink units for around 1,000 families around the state but haven’t specified a timeline for doing it.TechnologyChina urges US to protect its space station from satellitesChina pursues tech 'self-reliance,' fueling global uneaseHolmes jury to take break after six days of deliberationTusk says hacking marks crisis of democracy in Poland“Our kids can’t wait,” said Sanchez-Griego, adding that the investment is funded by federal relief money that will eventually run out paying for $100 monthly internet fees. “Our hope is that the state will come through.”___Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
