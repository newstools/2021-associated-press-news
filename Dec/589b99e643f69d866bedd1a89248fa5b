HONOLULU (AP) — Hospitals in Hawaii are bracing for an influx of COVID-19 patients as the state grapples with a sharp rise in new infections.According to the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, many hospital beds are already taken by patients that do not have the coronavirus, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. But with COVID-19 infection rates surging over the past week, including an increase of the omicron variant, officials expect more hospitalizations.“If the infection rate and positivity rate continues to increase, then that is a very strong determinant of a subsequent increase in hospitalizations,” said Hilton Rae­thel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii. “The infection rate and positivity rate occurring this week will result in hospitalizations next week after Christmas. If there continues to be an increase, then in the new year we’ll get another bump from that.”ADVERTISEMENTRaethel said about 2,239 of roughly 2,600 hospital beds are already occupied. As of Tuesday, 60 of those beds were coronavirus patients. “Our hospitals are already pretty full and fairly close to the peak we had during the (delta) surge, which is why we’re very concerned,” he said. During a summer surge of delta variant cases, some hospitals were full and 2,365 beds were occupied statewide.
