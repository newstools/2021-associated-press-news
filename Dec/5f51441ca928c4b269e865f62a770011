WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation on Thursday reported 78 more COVID-19 cases, but no additional deaths for the fourth time in the past five days.The latest numbers pushed the tribe’s total cases since the pandemic began to 40,334.The known death toll remains at 1,557.“Although we are hopeful that the omicron variant will not enter the Navajo Nation, we must anticipate it and prepare,” tribal President Jonathan Nez said in a statement Thursday. “The best way to prepare is to get more of our people fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and to get more booster shots to those who were previously vaccinated...We have to remain diligent and keep pushing back on the virus.”Nez has again called for everyone on the vast reservation to get a booster shot and wear masks.The reservation covers 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometers) and extends into parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
