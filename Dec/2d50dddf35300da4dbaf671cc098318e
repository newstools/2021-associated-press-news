CHICAGO (AP) — A Chicago firefighter has died days after he was badly burned helping battle an apartment building fire that killed one person and injured two others.After MaShawn Plummer, 30, died Tuesday at the Loyola University Medical Center, his body was moved to the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office in a procession that included fire trucks, ambulances and police vehicles.Officials said that Plummer suffered burns to his throat early on Dec. 16 while battling a fire in a two-story apartment building in the Belmont Central neighborhood during “very windy” conditions, said Larry Langford, a Chicago Fire Department spokesman. “It’s under investigation as to what happened inside,” Langford said. “But they lost contact with him and went in to find out why and found him down.”One other person, Eladio Gomez, 37, died as a result of the fire, while a woman and man were injured and were hospitalized in critical condition.Plummer, who was also an EMT with the Chicago Fire Department, had recently marked his first year as a Chicago firefighter. He was assigned to Engine 94 firehouse in the Portage Park neighborhood.Plummer is survived by his mother, father and four sisters.
