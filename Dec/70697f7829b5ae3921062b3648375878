GOOSE CREEK, S.C. (AP) — A city outside Charleston has become the latest community to ban people from openly carrying firearms at public events.The Goose Creek City Council on Tuesday approved the ban on public property at permitted events, including parades and protests.“As a council and as a city, and in consulting with our law enforcement, and all law enforcement sort of oppose the ability for people to open carry out in public events,” Mayor Greg Habib said. “It just creates more issues, as we see it, and our number one priority is the safety of our citizens.”Councilmember Hannah Cox was the lone vote against the measure. Cox told WCSC-TV that she voted no because she believes the measure encroaches on the Second Amendment rights of gun owners.Charleston passed a similar ordinance in July banning the open carrying of firearms at protests, WCIV-TV reported. Columbia has also banned open carry of guns at festivals and parades.
