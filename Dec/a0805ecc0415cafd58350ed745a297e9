MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — A panel of the Vermont Legislature recommended Tuesday that the legislature meet remotely for the first two weeks of the session that begins next week and then reassess to determine whether it will be safe to resume in-person meetings. The Legislature’s Joint Rules Committee made the recommendation Tuesday.State Sen. Alison Clarkson, a Woodstock Democrat, said they need to respond to the looming omicron surge in a safe and healthy way.“Only a fool doesn’t change their mind and with all the information we now have on what’s about to hit us, I think we would be foolish to place our public and our legislators and our staff at that risk,” Clarkson said.During the 2021 legislative session almost all Statehouse business was conducted remotely.After two weeks the body will reconsider its recommendation to meet remotely. The Tuesday recommendation by the Joint Rules Committee must be approved by the rules committees of both the Vermont House and Vermont Senate.
