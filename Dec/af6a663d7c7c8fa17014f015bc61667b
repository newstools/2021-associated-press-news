No. 4 UCLA has canceled its game scheduled for Saturday against North Carolina because of COVID-19 issues within the Bruins’ program, making it the second team to drop out of the four-team CBS Sports Classic in Las Vegas. UCLA said Friday that team-related activities have been paused while the status of future games remains to be determined. The Bruins had previously postponed a home game against Alabama State scheduled for earlier this week.The other game that was part of the Vegas event, a matchup between No. 15 Ohio State and No. 21 Kentucky, was canceled Thursday because of positive COVID-19 results within the Buckeyes program. Kentucky said the Wildcats were still scheduled to travel to Las Vegas to find a possible replacement game and are working with Classic officials to fill the void.Syracuse has also announced it is cancelling its next two games due to COVID-19 protocols. The school will determine whether Saturday’s scheduled game against Lehigh and next Tuesday’s scheduled game against Cornell can be made up later.ADVERTISEMENT“Our top priority is safeguarding the health and well-being of our student-athletes, athletics staff, fans and the campus and Central New York communities,” Syracuse athletic director John Wildhack said. “While it is disappointing to have to postpone any athletic event, this is the right decision given the increasingly difficult public health landscape.”
