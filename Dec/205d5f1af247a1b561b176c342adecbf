HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii set an all-time record for new coronavirus cases on Thursday as the state of about 1.5 million people reported nearly 3,500 new infections. The daily total of new cases reported by health officials was 3,484, topping the record of 2,205 cases set the day after Christmas. There has been a sharp and steady increase of new cases in Hawaii over the past 14 days. The state was averaging just over 100 new cases a day at the beginning of the month. A previous record for new daily infections was set in August during the peak of the delta variant surge when the state recorded 1,678 new infections. The latest surge came about two weeks after the first omicron variant case was confirmed in Hawaii. Hawaii hospital officials have said they are already nearly full with non-coronavirus patients and worry about staffing shortages affecting their ability to care for a possible surge of new COVID-19 patients.

Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said there would be no new restrictions on Oahu over the New Year holiday. He said people should take personal responsibility to help curb the spread of the disease.
