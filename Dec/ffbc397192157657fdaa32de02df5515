ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The last three months have been very dry in New Mexico and it’s only going to get worse.That’s the word from forecasters with the National Weather Service and other climate experts in the state. They said during a meeting this week that New Mexico reservoirs continue to be far below historical averages and that ranchers are bracing for a winter with little moisture out on the range. Some snow is expected in the higher elevation on Christmas Eve, but it will be less than the precipitation that has helped to ease drought conditions elsewhere in the West in recent weeks. Parts of California are in line for even  more snow. ADVERTISEMENT“Really the story is we had a dry year that is getting worse and worse as we move through this second La Niña,” said Andrew Mangham, a senior hydrologist with the weather service in Albuquerque.BusinessIn Africa, rescuing the languages that Western tech ignoresConsumer prices up 5.7% over past year, fastest in 39 yearsButtigieg doles out $241M to US ports to boost supply chainTo grandmother's house or no?
