Beach sued the team over how it handled his allegations of sexual assault by Aldrich. Beach alleged that he was assaulted by Aldrich during the team’s 2010 Stanley Cup run. Aldrich told investigators the encounter was consensual.Beach told investigators that Aldrich, a video coach at the time, threatened him with a souvenir baseball bat before forcibly performing oral sex on him and masturbating on the player’s back.An independent review, commissioned by the team and released in October, showed the organization badly mishandled Beach’s allegations.The fallout included top executives losing their jobs in Chicago and stretched to other teams, including the Florida Panthers, whose veteran coach, Joel Quenneville — the coach of the Blackhawks at the time — resigned. The NHL fined Chicago $2 million.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
