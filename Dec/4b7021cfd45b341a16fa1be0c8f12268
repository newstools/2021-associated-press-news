JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A child in Mississippi has died of influenza, marking the first pediatric flu death of the season, Mississippi Health Department officials say. The department of health did not release the age of the child who died or where in the state the death occurred. State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers said officials are starting to see increased numbers of flu cases in Mississippi. He said health care providers recommend that residents get flu shots every year, but even more now, amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “It is recommended to get vaccinated now before we reach peak flu activity,” he said. Byers said the flu vaccination can be given at the same time — or any time before or after — the COVID-19 vaccination.There have been a total of 23 pediatric flu deaths reported in Mississippi since the 2008-2009 flu season, according to the department of health. Flu season typically peaks in January through March in Mississippi, and the flu shot usually takes up to two weeks to produce immunity.
