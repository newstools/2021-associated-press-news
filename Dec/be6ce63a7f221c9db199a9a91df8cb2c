WELLS RIVER, Vt. (AP) — The owner of a Vermont hot chocolate company whose plant was destroyed by fire hopes to find a space to reopen and resume making premium hot chocolate powder mix by next months. Keith Lemnios, of Sillycow Farms, said he was searching for new space in the Wells River area where he can install manufacturing equipment that was ordered before the Tuesday fire engulfed the plant, which employed 28 people. “We have new equipment on order. The delivery schedule is for mid-January. We should be up-and-running by the end of January,” Lemnios told the Valley News. He said it was “certainly our preference” to remain in Wells River, but given the lack of manufacturing space in the rural area “I don’t want to guarantee that.”Lemnios said that processing and packaging is being temporarily transferred to plants in New York and Connecticut, which will be overseen by Sillycow.“We’re still in business. We’re using the equipment and labor from co-packers and production schedules will be managed by our team to assure quality,” Lemnios said. “We’re filling our orders.”The cause of the early morning fire is being investigated.
