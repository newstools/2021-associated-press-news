ST. JOHNSBURY, Vt. (AP) — Residents are beginning to move into apartments in a newly renovated building in downtown St. Johnsbury. The building at the corner of Railroad Street and Eastern Avenue has been under renovation for nearly two years, undergoing a more than $10 million transformation. The building was originally constructed in 1897 as a hotel. The three top floors of the building have 40 residential units and the first floor is for commercial tenants. It’s expected that nearly 20 tenants will move in this weekend. The Caledonian Record reports that plans initially called for people to begin occupying the apartments in September, but there were delays related to the arrival, installation and inspection of the new elevator.Earlier this week the first tenant moved in.
