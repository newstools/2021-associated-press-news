JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A buck found near Vicksburg has tested positive for Chronic Wasting Disease, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks said Thursday.The department said the mature buck was reported in mid-December as potentially diseased given its drastically emaciated and lethargic condition. It was found about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) north of Vicksburg and 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) south of the first CWD-positive white-tailed deer detected in the state. The test results are considered “suspect positive” through initial testing and will be sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, for final confirmation, the department said in a news release.Since February 2018, 111 CWD-positive white-tailed deer have been detected across nine counties. CWD is a fatal, neurological illness and there are no treatments or vaccines currently available, experts said.The department is still relying on hunter-harvested deer for the remainder of the 2021–22 hunting season. Hunters can submit deer for testing at established freezer locations or participating taxidermists.
