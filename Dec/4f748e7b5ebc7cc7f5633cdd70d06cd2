INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — With the surge in COVID-19 cases from the omicron variant expected to continue in the coming weeks, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and Indiana Hospital Association urged Hoosiers on Thursday to get vaccinated. The group said that getting vaccinated will help the state’s health care facilities stressed by the wave of coronavirus cases operate as needed and also help businesses avoid shutdowns.“We have never had this many total patients in our hospitals and we will soon match or surpass the greatest number of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic,” IHA President Brian Tabor said during a news conference Thursday. “Serious staffing shortages persist throughout the health care system and our capacity is extremely strained. The vast majority of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in Indiana are unvaccinated.”While the Indiana Chamber said it does not support government mandates for COVID-19 vaccinations and believes such an action should be “exclusively an employer’s choice,” the organization announced it has partnered with Franciscan Health to offer free Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine clinics on site to employers in all 92 Indiana counties. Both the initial vaccines and boosters are available.Coronavirus pandemicCathay Pacific suspends cargo flights due to virus controlsNew Year's Eve muted by omicron; many hoping for better 2022Live updates: Hong Kong reports cases of omicron spreadingMATCHDAY: City can stretch Premier League lead to 11 pointsADVERTISEMENTFor employers that find themselves with a suspected COVID-19 outbreak and need to test multiple employees, the Indiana Chamber said it has additionally secured COVID-19 testing kits that can be shipped to employers anywhere in the state. A curbside testing site will also be available on the northwest side of Indianapolis.“It has become increasingly clear that a vaccinated workforce is absolutely vital to Indiana’s future economic health,” said Indiana Chamber President Kevin Brinegar. “Many Hoosier businesses can’t afford to have another COVID outbreak or temporarily close. We have to remain vigilant and work together to ensure workplaces are as safe and virus-free as possible and remain in operation.”
