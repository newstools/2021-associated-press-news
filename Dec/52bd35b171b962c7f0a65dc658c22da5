Newspaper publisher Lee Enterprises has rejected a takeover offer from the Alden Global Capital hedge fund that is one of the largest newspaper owners in the country with a reputation for intense cost cuts and layoffs.Lee said Thursday that its board unanimously rejected Alden’s offer to buy the company for $24 per share or about $141 million because it isn’t in the best interests of shareholders. Also Thursday, Lee reported $5.3 million fiscal fourth-quarter profit this year, rebounding from a $1.3 million loss a year ago, as the number of digital-only subscribers at the company grew 65% to 402,000.“The Alden proposal grossly undervalues Lee and fails to recognize the strength of our business today, as the fastest-growing digital subscription platform in local media, and our compelling future prospects,” Lee Chairman Mary Junck said. When it made its offer last month, New York-based Alden said it already owned more than 6% of Lee’s stock. Alden didn’t immediately respond to Lee Thursday morning.ADVERTISEMENTAfter Alden made its unsolicited bid, Lee adopted a “poison-pill” plan that would make it more expensive for Alden to buy up Lee’s shares once it owns more than 10% of the company. Lee also rebuffed Alden’s attempt to nominate three new directors to the company’s board.BusinessAP-NORC Poll: Income is up, but Americans focus on inflationDrivers playing video games?
