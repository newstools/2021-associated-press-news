A former Dominion Voting Systems executive has sued Tulsa businessman and talk show host Clay Clark, accusing Clark of defamation, civil conspiracy and intentional distress for his unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential election being rigged.Eric Coomer, formerly director of product strategy and security for Dominion, sued Clark last week in federal district court in Denver, the Tulsa World reported.The suit, which names Clark personally and one of his companies as defendants, says Clark recklessly spread false, damaging and potentially dangerous claims about Coomer, and seeks unspecified damages, the newspaper reported.In a statement sent to The Associated Press in response to the lawsuit, Clark said “election fraud is making it possible for these unconstitutional tyrannical actions against the American people to be taken.”ADVERTISEMENTCoomer has sued numerous purveyors of largely debunked conspiracies about the 2020 election, including former President Donald Trump’s campaign, two of its lawyers and some conservative media figures and outlets.Dominion Voting Systems provides election support in at least 30 states, according to Coomer’s filing.
