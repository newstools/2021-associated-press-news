CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Nevada is scaling back indoor masking requirements in two more counties.State health officials announced Tuesday that the masking requirements for vaccinated people will be lifted Friday in rural Storey and White Pine counties because the two counties had low or moderate risk of transmission of the coronavirus for the second straight week.Storey and White Pine counties join Esmaraldo County, which was released from a masking requirement for vaccinated people in late November.Officials said three additional counties — Lander, Eureka and Lincoln — are listed as having low or moderate risks of transmission this week. Vaccinated people in those three counties wouldn’t be subject to indoor masking requirements if the counties maintain a low or moderate risk of transmission for another week, officials said.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists all other Nevada counties, including those where the cities of Las Vegas and Reno are located, with high transmission and are subject to continued marking requirements.People who aren’t vaccinated are still required to wear masks in indoor settings in all counties statewide.
