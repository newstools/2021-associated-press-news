Iowa State, which was severely limited by playing star tailback Breece Hall, mustered just 270 yards and 14 first downs against a Clemson defense that came into the game second in the nation in scoring defense.ADVERTISEMENTGoodrich sealed Clemson’s victory with 33 seconds to play when he stripped the ball away from Iowa State quarterback Brock Purdy on a fourth-and-2 play.

Goodrich’s 18-yard scoring run gave Clemson two scores in a 53-second stretch of the third quarter to push the score to 20-3.Iowa State cut it 20-13 with 9:42 to play on Andrew Mevis’ third field goal and Purdy’s 6-yard touchdown pass to Charlie Kolar.Purdy completed 22 of 39 passes for 204 yards, but his two turnovers proved costly.THE TAKEAWAY Swinney, who guided the Tigers to national championships in 2016 and ’18 and to six straight College Football Playoff trips, is the sixth fastest in college football history to 150 victories and just the third to do so in fewer than 15 years. UP NEXTClemson: Uiagalelei is expected to return, but he could be challenged by five-star signee Cade Klubnik for the starting job. Klubnik is expected to enroll at Clemson in January and go through spring practice in hopes of competing for the starting job. Iowa State: The Cyclones will be hard-pressed to keep up their recent run of success with 19 senior starters departing — 17 of which had at least 21 starts. Much of the future will be dependent on coach Matt Campbell replacing Purdy and Hall.
