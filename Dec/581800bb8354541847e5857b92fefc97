LAS VEGAS (AP) — A pact to retain the Las Vegas-area schools chief and patch his rift with the elected board of trustees calls for outside mediation performed in private to resolve their disputes, a newspaper reported.The three top elected officers of the Clark County School District board signed the agreement ahead of an announcement Dec. 3 that Superintendent Jesus Jara’s firing had been rescinded and that he would continue to lead the nation’s fifth-largest school district through January 2023, the Las Vegas Sun reported  Wednesday.Board President Linda Cavazos attached a note to the agreement saying she would have preferred that all seven trustees sign it, not just Cavazos, board Vice President Evelyn Garcia Morales and Clerk Irene Cepeda.The eight-page document acquired by the Sun through a public records request does not directly address Jara’s demand for $2 million to drop accusations he made through his lawyer of harassment and a hostile work environment.ADVERTISEMENTThe two sides agreed to the written resolution after months of turmoil led to a 4-3 board vote Oct. 28 to fire Jara, with no reason stated, and another 4-3 vote on Nov. 19 to retain him.

The document said the two sides maintained “different positions regarding the legal effect of the board’s action to rescind the termination” and said any future move to terminate Jara’s contract would also go to mediation.The document identifies the board as a collective body, meaning that Jara is accountable to the board as a whole.“There is no individual authority to give direction to the superintendent or any district staff member regarding the management of the district or the solution of a specific problem,” the document said.The board plans to consider adding the assurances into Jara’s contract at a January meeting.“The superintendent and the board shall maintain a collegial and professional working relationship that is in the best interests of the district,” the document said.ADVERTISEMENTNews about the pact coincided with a study ranking the Las Vegas area second-to-last for school quality, behind Honolulu, Hawaii, among the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas.The report was published by the Thomas B. Fordham Institute policy think tank with support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation.The Clark County School District has about 315,000 students and 18,000 teachers in 336 schools in an area the size of New Jersey.
