SEATTLE (AP) — A Seattle hospital leader said Thursday that omicron has become the dominant coronavirus strain in King County and much of Western Washington. Dr. John Lynch, Harborview’ Medical Center’s medical director for infection prevention and control, said in a statement the super-infectious variant will soon overtake delta throughout the rest of the state, The Seattle Times reported. Scientists now know omicron spreads fast — perhaps up to three times faster than the delta variant. It also seems to be better at evading vaccines, although boosters help particularly against hospitalization and death. Some research suggests omicron causes less severe illness than delta does, but the studies are preliminary.ADVERTISEMENTOmicron even if milder could still overwhelm hospitals because of the sheer number of infections.Lynch said healthy people who are fully vaccinated and have received a booster shot “should mostly expect coldlike symptoms” if they get sick from the variant.
