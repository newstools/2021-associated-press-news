BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Public health officials reported Idaho’s first case of the omicron variant of coronavirus on Friday in an adult who recently had traveled out-of-state. Central District Health, the public health agency that serves four counties and includes the Boise region, said the variant was confirmed in a lab sample from an Ada County residents who is over the age of 50. The resident was fully vaccinated and had only mild symptoms, Central District Health said in a news release. The World Health Organization has classified omicron as a “variant of concern” and it has now been found in several states. Scientists are working to determine details about the new variant including whether it evades immunity — though early indications suggest it may be more easily transmissible but cause less severe illness than the delta variant, which is widespread in Idaho. ADVERTISEMENTExperts say the best way to protect against the omicron variant is the same way as any other variant: By getting vaccinated and boosted when eligible, by wearing a mask and avoiding crowds.
