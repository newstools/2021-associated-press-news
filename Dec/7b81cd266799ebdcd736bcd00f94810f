NEW YORK (AP) — Super Bowl champions Patrick Mahomes, Ben Roethlisberger, Lavonte David, Jason McCourty and Matthew Slater are among the players nominated for the NFL’s sportsmanship award.Each NFL team nominated one of its players for the award, which recognizes players around the league who exemplify outstanding sportsmanship on the field. The award was created in 2014 in honor of the late founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Rooney. The winner will be revealed as part of NFL Honors, the prime-time TV show on Feb. 9 during which The Associated Press announces its individual season award winners.A panel of former players — Pro Football Hall of Famer Curtis Martin, Warrick Dunn, Leonard Wheeler, and 2014 Art Rooney Sportsmanship Award recipient Larry Fitzgerald — will select eight finalists, four from each conference. The eight finalists will be listed on the Pro Bowl ballot under the NFL Sportsmanship Award category when players vote later this month. As in Pro Bowl voting, a team member cannot vote for a teammate.ADVERTISEMENTThe winner will receive a $25,000 donation from the NFL Foundation to a charity of his choice.NFLMahomes among 5 champions recognized for sportsmanshipFlorida signs veteran secondary coach Raymond away from LSUAP SportlightAP-Sportlight-Week AheadPast winners are Teddy Bridgewater, Adrian Peterson, Drew Brees, Luke Kuechly, Frank Gore, and Fitzgerald.The nominees:Arizona Cardinals, Budda BakerAtlanta Falcons, Jake MatthewsBaltimore Ravens, Lamar JacksonBuffalo Bills, Josh AllenCarolina Panthers, Frankie LuvuChicago Bears, Roquan SmithCincinnati Bengals, Stanley MorganCleveland Browns, Nick ChubbDallas Cowboys, Dak PrescottDenver Broncos, Pat Surtain IIDetroit Lions, Jamaal WilliamsGreen Bay Packers, Aaron JonesHouston Texans, Brandin CooksIndianapolis Colts, DeForest BucknerJacksonville Jaguars, Shaquill GriffinKansas City Chiefs, Patrick MahomesLas Vegas Raiders, Derek CarrLos Angeles Chargers, Derwin JamesLos Angeles Rams, Jordan FullerMiami Dolphins, Jason McCourtyMinnesota Vikings, Adam ThielenNew England Patriots, Matthew SlaterNew Orleans Saints, Cameron JordanNew York Giants, James BradberryNew York Jets, C.J.
