HONOLULU (AP) — The University of Hawaii will conduct mostly online classes for the first two weeks of the spring semester as the state watches a surge in omicron coronavirus cases. Hawaii has had all-time record high daily COVID-19 numbers in recent days. University of Hawaii officials said in a statement Tuesday that campuses across the islands will temporarily move many classes to online instruction.In an email to students and staff, University of Hawaii President David Lassner said only classes that can be “effectively taught online” will change. Other classes will be taught in person but with physical distancing, mask wearing and health screenings in place.“We are not changing course modalities but merely making this adjustment to maximize the safety of our campuses including those who may be returning from another island or farther,” said Lassner in the announcement. “We are disappointed to take this action but believe it is appropriate to protect the health and safety of our students and employees.”University of Hawaii students and staff must be fully vaccinated unless they have an approved exemption. Unvaccinated people who get exemptions must test regularly.
