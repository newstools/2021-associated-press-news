BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) — Coronavirus cases in Slovakia hit a daily record despite the country entering a national lockdown last week, the Health Ministry reported Friday.The ministry said Slovakia confirmed 15,278 new cases on Thursday, almost 5,000 more than the previous record set Nov 23. The government ordered a two-week lockdown that started Nov. 25.

Under the lockdown, people are allowed to leave their homes only for specific reasons, and those who are unvaccinated and have not recovered from COVID-19 are required to get tested for the virus to attend work.ADVERTISEMENTSlovakia’s parliament is debating a government proposal to pay people 60 and older a 500-euro ($567) bonus if they get vaccinated against COVID-19.
