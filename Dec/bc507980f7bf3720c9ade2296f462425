NORFOLK, Va. (AP) — Virginia’s Old Dominion University has received a prestigious designation for being a high-level research institution. The state school of nearly 25,000 students in Norfolk announced this week that it’s now considered to be a “Research 1” institution by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.The designation is based off of factors that include research doctorates awarded, research expenditures and the number of research staff. ODU is nationally known for research involving sea-level rise, hurricanes and adapting to climate change. Its faculty and staff also focus on areas such as port logistics, maritime engineering and cybersecurity. The school is also a key academic partner for NASA’s Langley Research Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Defense. “ODU’s strategy has been to focus on research that is meaningful to people living and working in Hampton Roads that also is applicable globally,” said Morris Foster, the university’s vice president for research. The school said external funding for applied research projects has tripled in the last five years. And the number of scientific publications from ODU faculty has doubled in the past decade.
