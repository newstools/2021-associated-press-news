EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — New York Giants quarterback Daniel Jones is likely to miss his third straight game because of a neck injury.Coach Joe Judge said Wednesday the third-year quarterback still has not been cleared for contact and Mike Glennon will start Sunday against the NFC East-leading Dallas Cowboys (9-4). Jones was hurt Nov. 28 in a game against the Philadelphia Eagles. He was seen by a specialist on the West Coast this past week as the Giants (4-9) prepared to play a game in Los Angeles against the Chargers. The No. 6 pick overall in 2019 got a second opinion about his injury in New York on Monday.Judge said Jones’ status has not changed, which puts him on a week-to-week basis. He added Jones could develop his game by playing, but he will not be put on the field in a game unless healthy.The Giants have lost to Miami and the Chargers in the games Jones missed. Jake Fromm will be the backup to Glennon. Fromm has never taken a snap in an NFL regular-season game. ADVERTISEMENTNOTES: Rookie wide receiver Kadarius Toney was placed on the reserve/COVID 19 list on Monday. Judge said receiver John Ross and linebacker Oshane Ximines tested positive on Wednesday.
