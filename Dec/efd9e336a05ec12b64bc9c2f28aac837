AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — An abandoned Maine Central Railroad Company corridor is being converted to a new multi-use trail. The Madison Branch spans 32 miles across Kennebec and Somerset Counties and will connect with the Maine Interconnected Trail System and Maine ATV Trail System, officials said.“Snowmobiles and ATVs are as much a part of the Maine outdoor experience as hiking boots, snowshoes, and skis,” said Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. “My administration has listened to our off-road recreational vehicle riding community who wants to be able to travel long distances, legally and safely, and have a good time. ”The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry completed the purchase in November from Pan Am Railways at the cost of just over $1 million.
