After a grueling season and an agonizing wait to be confirmed as Formula One champion, Max Verstappen was in a hurry to finally get the party started.Leaving proved harder.The sun was already rising over Abu Dhabi when Verstappen left the celebrations around 7 a.m. local time.“All the emotions they come out,” the bleary-eyed Dutchman said on a video call on Monday. “So it was a lot of fun.
