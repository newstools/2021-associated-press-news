NEW ORLEANS (AP) — One private university in New Orleans has delayed the start of its spring semester because of the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, and another says students must get booster shots before returning. Tulane University has pushed the semester’s beginning back one week, to Jan. 25, The Times-Picayune / The New Orleans Advocate reported.Loyola University is keeping its Jan. 18 start for most classes and Jan. 10 at its law school but is requiring both booster shots and proof of a negative test for the coronavirus. Students not yet eligible for a booster must get one six months after their basic vaccination, the school said.The statements Thursday came as Louisiana’s Department of Health estimated that the omicron variant made up more than 84% of all cases diagnosed in the week that ended Dec. 18 and people in New Orleans lined up for testing.ADVERTISEMENTA line of cars circled the Mahalia Jackson Auditorium for drive-thru tests, though there was plenty of room at a vaccination tent, WWL-TV reported. Pharmacies and health clinics throughout the area told the station they had full appointment calendars for shots, boosters and, especially, COVID-19 tests.
