SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — More than 150 residents of a high-rise senior housing complex were allowed back home Wednesday after power was restored in the wake of an electrical substation fire.Residents of the 12-story Edgewater, a city-subsidized apartment building, were allowed back following an inspection of the building, Angela Jones, spokeswoman for the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency, told the Sacramento Bee.The building was evacuated after the fire at the electrical facility a block away knocked out power to dozens of downtown buildings in a 12-block-by-5-block area shortly before noon Tuesday. Fire officials said that while some buildings had backup generators, the senior complex didn’t, meaning there wasn’t any power to operate ventilators and other medical devices needed by some elderly residents. Lights, heating, elevators and a fire sprinkler system also were down.ADVERTISEMENTSome residents went to relatives while others were placed in hotels or sheltered at City Hall.Victoria Foreman, 64, waited in her ninth-floor apartment in the dark until firefighters arrived to escort her out of the building.

I had to come down the stairs.”The fire also cut power to about 1,300 customers but the Sacramento Municipal Utility District said electricity was restored to 750 by morning and it hoped to have all customers back online by Friday morning.The cause of the fire was under investigation.
