ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — The University of New Mexico is requiring all employees and students to get a COVID-19 booster shot by Jan. 17.The university said Wednesday the new requirement, which expands on the previous vaccination requirement, applies to all individuals eligible for booster shots but that some religious and medical-based exemptions may be granted.Individuals who are eligible for booster shots are those who received their second vaccine dose of Pfizer or Moderna on or before June 15, or their single dose of Johnson & Johnson on or before Oct. 15.“As a university, our vaccination rates for students, faculty, and staff are well over 90 percent, and I anticipate our booster rate will be similarly successful,” UNM President Garnett Stokes said in a statement.
