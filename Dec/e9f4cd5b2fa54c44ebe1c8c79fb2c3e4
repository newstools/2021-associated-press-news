BALTIMORE (AP) — A Maryland man has been sentenced to more than three years in prison for engaging in a scheme in which he and others opened bank accounts using stolen identifications, then quickly withdrew money obtained through stolen or altered checks, federal prosecutors said.Erwin Boateng, 32, of Glen Burnie, was sentenced on Friday to 42 months in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release, U.S. Attorney Erek Barron’s office said in a news release. U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett also ordered Boateng to forfeit nearly $25,000.According to a plea agreement, Boateng and others opened more than three dozen bank accounts using the stolen personal identifying information of other individuals or in the names of businesses. Boateng and his co-conspirators fraudulently transferred funds or deposited stolen and altered checks, then transferred the funds to other accounts or withdrew the funds in cash, the news release said. Boateng pleaded guilty to bank fraud conspiracy in September 2019.Four other people have pleaded guilty to participating in the same scheme and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 13 months to three years.
