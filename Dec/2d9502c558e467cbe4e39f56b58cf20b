The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Connecticut has risen from 1,525 new cases on Dec. 7 to 2,729 on Dec. 21, according to Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The state reported that 821 people were hospitalized Wednesday with COVID-19. The governor’s office was set to release its weekly accounting of COVID-19 deaths on Thursday afternoon. In response to the new cases, the state Department of Public Health has rescinded guidance that would have allowed vaccinated high school athletes in the state to stop wearing masks during competition beginning on Friday. Dr. Manisha Juthan, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement that the rapid rise in cases and the omicron variant “forced us to reconsider that assessment.”“Guidance that has been in place for winter sports throughout this season will remain in place,” Juthan said. “In line with our neighboring states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, DPH is advising that all participants continuously wear a mask over the nose and mouth during all indoor athletic activities to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our state and region.”
