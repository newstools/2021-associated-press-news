NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A store that’s made it feel like Christmas year-round in New Orleans’ French Quarter is closing up shop after 44 years.Santa’s Quarters is shutting down its brick-and-mortar location Dec. 15, WGNO-TV reports. Owner David Erath says the business’ website, santasquarters.com, will continue selling commercial items and artificial Christmas trees.“We’ve had a lot of people come in and say they came here as children and came with their parents and grandparents and so forth,” Erath told the station. “It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve the community.”Santa’s Quarters has typically only been closed for Mardi Gras and Christmas.Erath, a New Orleans local, acquired the business in 2005. He said several staff members have worked at the store for at least 30 years or more and are at retirement age.ADVERTISEMENT“We’ve all grown up together in this business, and we are all ready to go to pasture,” Erath said.The COVID-19 pandemic and Hurricane Ida were both factors in the decision to close the store, according to the owner.Items not sold by the last day of business will be donated to a local preservation and beautification organization that sponsors Christmas caroling in Jackson Square.
