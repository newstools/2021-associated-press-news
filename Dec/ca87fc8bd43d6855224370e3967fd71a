ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Forecasters say a winter storm that will hit New Mexico on Friday and Saturday is expected to produce severe driving conditions due to high winds and drifting snow with heavy snow accumulations in the mountains.“Widespread and significant impacts to holiday travel are expected,” the weather service said in a statement Thursday.While temperatures Friday will be low enough for valleys to get rainfall, “drastically colder air will arrive after midnight and allow any rain to change over to snow through Saturday morning,” the weather service said.Over the weekend, strong winds will combine with bitterly cold temperatures Saturday and Sunday to produce what the forecasters described as “dangerously cold wind chills.”
