BOSTON (AP) — Three New England universities are finalists in a federal contest to get up to $100 million in pandemic relief funds to rebuild communities. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced 60 finalists Monday for the $1 billion “Build Back Better Regional Challenge,” including the University of Rhode Island, Northeastern University and the University of Maine system. Chosen from about 530 applicants, the finalists each receive about $500,000 to develop their proposals. Up to half of the regional coalitions will get up to $100 million each to implement their projects that support an industry sector. The URI Research Foundation proposed working with the state of Rhode Island and a regional team to transform and grow the state’s “blue economy” by advancing new ocean technology developments and creating jobs in shipping, defense, marine trades, ocean-based renewables, tourism, aquaculture and fisheries.
