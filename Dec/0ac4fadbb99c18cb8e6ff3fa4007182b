CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hampshire tourism officials are expecting a good winter season, with more than 3 million people projected to travel to the state and spend $1.2 billion.“We’re optimistic heading into winter,” Taylor Caswell, commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs, said at a travel forecast event this week. “We know the outdoor recreation assets in New Hampshire like our ski resorts and winter trail networks are among the largest drivers of our state’s economy,” he said. “They bring tourists to spend a weekend but also increasingly more new residents seeking to restore their work/life balance.”The state’s Division of Travel and Tourism has returned to marketing in the Quebec and Ontario provinces once again, because the U.S.-Canada border has reopened to non-essential travel. New Hampshire’s winter advertising campaign highlights skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling and snowshoeing, as well as shopping, dining and lodging.
