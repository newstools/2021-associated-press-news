NEW YORK (AP) — Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant has been fined $25,000 by the NBA for directing obscene language toward a fan during a game in Atlanta.The fine was announced Sunday by Byron Spruell, the president of league operations.It stems from an incident Friday night when a fan heckled at Durant with 28 seconds to go in the second quarter of the Nets’ 113-105 victory over Hawks. In video taken courtside that was posted on social media, an off-camera fan can be heard yelling, “Durant, stop crying!” before Durant responds using multiple expletives.Durant scored 31 points, including the go-ahead jumper midway through the fourth quarter, in the win.___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
