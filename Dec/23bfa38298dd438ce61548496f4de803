We understand that. It’s no secret,” coach James Borrego said. “The bottom five teams defensively just don’t win consistently in this league. I’ve never seen that. Top-tier defenses do. That’s our goal.”Bucks: With C Brook Lopez sidelined since the opener (back soreness), Milwaukee signed veteran free agent DeMarcus Cousins, who was available Wednesday night. The 6-foot-10 Cousins averaged 8.9 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 17.4 minutes in 41 games last season with the Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Clippers. Cousins played 14 minutes, scoring seven points. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game that he thought Cousins is “mentally ... in a good place, so we’re excited about having him for, whatever this is, 60 games or so.” UP NEXTHornets: At Atlanta on Sunday.Bucks: At Toronto on Thursday. ___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
