HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Federal authorities have approved Connecticut’s plan to spend $7.2 million in COVID-19 relief funds to help schools identify students who are homeless and help make sure they can still attend school. Education Commissioner Charlene M. Russell-Tucker, who announced Thursday that the funding has been approved, said the Connecticut State Department of Education is trying to make sure students experiencing homelessness and unstable housing situations receive the behavioral health and academic help they need so they can go to school and fully participate in school activities.“This funding will enable CSDE to provide direct support to schools and districts to identify and support students during this critical time,” she said in a statement.Funding for Connecticut’s plan, which received input from students, families, school staff and community groups, comes as problems like homelessness have intensified over the past 20 months of the pandemic, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement.
