OPELIKA, Ala. (AP) — A $3,000 state tax credit meant to recognize victims of an east Alabama tornado that killed about two dozen people will be available for homeowners who install a storm shelter after Jan. 1. Rep. Joe Lovvorn, whose home suffered significant damage in the 2019 twister, spearheaded the legislation, WRBL-TV reported. Lovvorn said the program has a cap of $2 million annually for three years.“Serving as a first responder to many tornadoes over the years, I feel we must find ways for the people of Alabama to prioritize safety. This bill would allow them to recoup some of their investment through tax savings. A storm shelter tax credit is not a solution for all, but it is another way to return tax savings to the people that could save their life,” said Lovvorn.ADVERTISEMENTLee County Emergency Management Agency Director Rita Smith said that to be eligible, a shelter needs to be FEMA approved; capable of withstanding an EF-5 tornado; and built on the applicant’s property.A twister struck the Lee County community of Beauregard on March 3, 2019, killing 23 people.
