Slavens was captured later that night and Smith was captured in Oklahoma at midday Saturday, authorities said.The pair escaped by climbing through the ceiling in one of the jail pods and then making it onto the building’s roof by using an electronic tablet as a light source. They then found a water hose on the roof and used it to rappel down the side of the jail, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.

I could stand up here and try and give you reasons, but there’s not. There’s no excuse for what happened.”LifestyleFor celebrations, English fizz is on the riseRecipe: Savory miso balances one-note bananas FosterCOVID-19 makes Biden's 1st White House Christmas less merryAdvertisements draw flak in China over Asian stereotypesSlavens was being held on charges of failing to appear in court, possession of drug paraphernalia and theft.
