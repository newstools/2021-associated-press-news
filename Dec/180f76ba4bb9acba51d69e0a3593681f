BEREA, Ohio (AP) — The Browns could be missing two more key players for Sunday’s vital matchup against the Baltimore Ravens.Cleveland placed starting linebacker Anthony Walker Jr. and punter Jamie Gillan on the reserve-COVID-19 list on Thursday, making it unlikely they’ll be able to play.Earlier this week, the Browns put tight end David Njoku, who leads the team in yards receiving, on the COVID-19 list.The losses of Walker and Gillan would be a major blow to the Browns (6-6), who trail the first-place Ravens (8-4) by two games in the division and can’t afford another loss as they chase an AFC playoffs sport for the second year in a row.Any vaccinated player on the list has to be asymptomatic and twice test negative in a 24-hour span to be eligible to play. The latest a team can activate a player from the list is Saturday at 4 p.m.Walker is the team’s leading tackler and has been a steadying presence in his first season with the Browns.Gillan has had a rough season, but the Browns don’t have a backup on the roster and will need to sign one.___More AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL
