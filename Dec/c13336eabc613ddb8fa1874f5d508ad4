BERLIN (AP) — Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to write an autobiographical book explaining her most important political decisions, a news outlet in Germany quoted a close aide as saying Friday.Merkel, 67, handed over the chancellorship to successor Olaf Scholz on Wednesday after a near-record 16 years in power. She didn’t seek a fifth term in office and hasn’t disclosed her future plans, though she has said in the past that she will not seek another political role.Merkel’s longtime office manager, Beate Baumann, told news weekly Der Spiegel that Merkel “doesn’t want to retell her whole life. She would like to explain her central political decisions in her own words, and referring to her journey through life.”ADVERTISEMENTBaumann said the book is envisioned as a two- to three-year project and doesn’t yet have a publisher, according to Der Spiegel. “The chancellor and I are sure that, if we do this book, then we will do it alone, without ghostwriters, without historians, without journalists,” she said.EntertainmentMichael Nesmith, the Monkee for all seasons, dies at 782021 in Books: `Everything feels magnified'2 stars of 'It's a Wonderful Life' look back at a classicPop superstar Alicia Keys unveils new album 'KEYS' in DubaiMerkel, a former scientist who grew up in East Germany, entered politics as communism crumbled and joined then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s first post-reunification government in 1990.
