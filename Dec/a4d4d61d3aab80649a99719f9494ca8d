FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) — Police officers in Massachusetts were justified when they shot and killed an armed New Hampshire man who opened fire at them last month, investigators said Wednesday.Two Seekonk officers fired a combined 10 rounds at Jeffrey W. Groulx the morning of Nov. 28 after he fired at them, according to the investigation conducted by the office of Bristol District Attorney Thomas Quinn III.“The sudden and unexpected firing of the rifle by Groulx reasonably caused the officers to fear that they would be killed or suffer serious bodily injury,” the report concluded. “As a result of Groulx’s actions, the officers were justified in using deadly force. In the circumstances ... no crimes were committed by either officer.”Groulx, who had ties to Boston and Ashland, New Hampshire, as well as other areas of the state, had a long criminal history and was armed with an AK-47 style rifle, the district attorney said.ADVERTISEMENTPolice were investigating a possible break-in at a tire store at about 6:45 a.m. when they encountered Groulx, according to the investigation. He was later seen leaving the parking lot of another business driving a black car.BusinessWidespread flight cancellations continue as omicron spreadsChina urges US to protect its space station from satellitesTexas oil billionaire William 'Tex' Moncrief Jr. dead at 101US move to shorten COVID-19 isolation stirs confusion, doubtHe left the area at a high rate of speed before losing control of the car, striking a curb and rolling the vehicle onto its passenger side, prosecutors said.Groulx fired twice from inside the vehicle as officers approached to render aid, the report said.

Groulx was pronounced dead at the scene of two gunshot wounds, including one to the head.
