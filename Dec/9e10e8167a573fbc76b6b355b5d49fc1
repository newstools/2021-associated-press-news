NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee officials say a 13th county has a confirmed case of chronic wasting disease in deer. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency says a deer harvested in Crockett County has tested positive. The state says the disease has been found in white-tailed deer in Chester, Crockett, Fayette, Gibson, Hardeman, Haywood, Henry, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Shelby, Tipton and Weakley counties, and within 10 miles of four others. Additional regulations on carcass transport, feeding and mineral placement have been imposed in those counties. The condition is a progressive, fatal disease of the nervous system in the deer family.Though there haven’t yet been cases recorded in humans, the agency recommends people avoid eating meat from infected deer. The agency says the disease may spread through contact with contaminated body fluids, tissue or indirect contact. It may incubate for more than a year, and infected animals may slowly develop symptoms, including stumbling, listlessness, drooling and excessive thirst.
