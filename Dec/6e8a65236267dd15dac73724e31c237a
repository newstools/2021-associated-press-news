BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Kristen Hayden became the first Black woman to win a U.S. national senior title when she paired with Quinn Henninger for a victory in mixed synchronized 3-meter Monday at the USA Diving winter national championships.Hayden, a recent transfer to Indiana University, and freshman Henninger took the lead on their third dive of the competition. Their next two dives earned mostly 7.0s and 7.5s for a total score of 286.86 points, three points ahead of Carson Tyler and Anne Fowler.It was the first synchro competition together for Henninger and Hayden.Hayden joined Mike Wright as the only Black divers to win U.S. national titles. Wright won on 1-meter springboard in 2012. “I don’t think words can even describe the feeling,” Hayden said. “You read about people like that, you watch Serena Williams, Simone Biles, Simone Manuel, but when it’s yourself, it’s insane. I think the whole diving community is headed in the right direction and I just want to be a good example for young Black Americans or any minority really for diving in the U.S.”ADVERTISEMENTHayden is the first Black American diver to earn a bid to the world championships in May in Japan. She was a team member at the 2016 junior worlds.SportsCurry falls short of record, but leads Warriors past PacersTatum scores 42, carries Celtics past Bucks 117-103USA Gymnastics, USOPC reach $380M settlement with victimsAP All-America team: Young and Tide lead with 3 1st teamersShe is a founding member of USA Diving’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council.
