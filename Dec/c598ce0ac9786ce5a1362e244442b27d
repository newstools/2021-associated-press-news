KINGSPORT, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to reopen public facilities at the Boone Dam and Reservoir next spring, officials said.The beach, bathhouses and the visitors center, which were closed while crews worked to repair the dam, will reopen in time for Memorial Day, TVA officials said Tuesday, the Johnson City Press reported. “Everything you were able to do before, you’ll be able to do again,” said Chris Saucier, technical director of the Boone Dam project.The Tennessee Valley Authority discovered a sinkhole at the base of Boone Dam’s earthen embankment in 2014 and began work to repair it the following year.“It’s been a challenge,” Saucier said. “I know it’s certainly been a challenge for folks in the community, but we’re happy to say we’re on track for delivering this and returning to normal next year in July.”
