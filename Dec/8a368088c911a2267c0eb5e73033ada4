MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee third grader whose fears about COVID-19 were alleviated by President Joe Biden when he came to Wisconsin for a televised town hall came away from the encounter with both comfort and joy.The joy came when Layla Salas and her family, at the president’s invitation, attended the holiday open house at the White House on Saturday. The 9-year-old girl told the Journal Sentinel that her favorite part of the tour was seeing the Green Room filled with Christmas trees decorated with purple.“It was better than a cookie on a hot summer day,” she exclaimed.It all started in February when her mom, Jessica Salas, asked Biden on behalf of Layla when the vaccine would be available for kids. Biden responded directly to Layla, explaining that kids were not at a high of a risk of getting severe COVID-19 infection and that the vaccine for children wasn’t ready just yet.ADVERTISEMENT“Don’t be scared, honey. Don’t be scared. You’re going to be fine, and we’re going to make sure mommy’s fine, too,” Biden said. Coronavirus pandemicWashington state Sen.
