PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona is reporting fewer than 3,000 new confirmed COVID-19 cases for a second day after two weeks of higher numbers.The state coronavirus dashboard on Tuesday reported 2,168 additional cases as well as 203 deaths from the virus. Health officials, however, added that most of the fatalities were reported after inspection of death certificates going back several weeks. Since the pandemic started, the state has seen 1,320,748 cases and 23,243 deaths in all. Hospitalizations for COVID-19 inched up somewhat to 2,764 patients as of Monday. The number of hospitalized remain far below the pandemic peak of 5,082 last January. Still, hospital staffs have been stretched thin between COVID-19 patients and patients who need treatment for other illnesses or surgeries.Tuesday marks one year since COVID-19 vaccines first arrived in Arizona, according to the Department of Health Services. So far, more than 4.5 million people — or 63.8% of the population — in the state have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Over 3.9 million have been fully vaccinated. Of the state’s vaccine-eligible population, 67.8% have received at least one dose. Public health officials say unvaccinated people are 15.2 times more likely to die than those who are fully vaccinated for COVID-19.
