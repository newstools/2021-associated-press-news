RENO. Nev. (AP) — A state District Court has overturned the Reno City Council’s denial of a new housing development and ordered the City Council to approve the controversial project.Council members had cited concerns over fire danger, hillside cuts and traffic when the Mortenson Ranch was rejected last March, but Judge Kathleen Drakulich ruled last week that the council’s 6-1 denial was an “abuse of discretion” and “without substantial evidentiary support.”Councilman Devon Reese , who voted against the project in March, told KRNV-TV  that he was surprised that the judge overturned the council’s decision. The council could appeal the ruling or approve the project under conditions set in the judge’s order, Reese said.The project would be located in the Verdi area on the Reno’s far western outskirts and the biggest concern aired during the March meeting was fire danger.Developers agreed to install fire sprinklers in homes but that didn’t assuage concerns.
