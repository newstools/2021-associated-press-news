PARIS (AP) — Two-time Olympic swimming champion Yannick Agnel has admitted to having a relationship with an underage girl but denied coercion, the prosecutor in the Frenchman’s rape case said Monday.Prosecutor Edwige Roux-Morizot said Agnel “recognizes the materiality of the alleged facts” but she said he did not have “the feeling that there was coercion.”“If the facts constitute rape or sexual assault, it is because there is a significant age difference,” Roux-Morizot said.Agnel was 24 when the alleged rape took place. The girl was reportedly 13.Agnel was arrested in Paris last week. On Saturday, he was handed preliminary charges and the case was sent to Mulhouse, eastern France.Roux-Morizot also said the events took place in 2016 in several locations, including Spain, Thailand and Brazil.In France, an adult cannot have consensual sex with somebody under 15 years old. Earlier this year, the French parliament adopted legislation that characterises sex with a child under the age of 15 as rape and punishable by up to 20 years in jail, bringing its penal code closer in line with many other western nations.ADVERTISEMENTSportsRodgers throws 4 TD passes, Packers defeat Bears 45-30Tom Brady's 700th TD pass lifts Bucs over Bills 33-27 in OTLeBron scores 30, Lakers top Magic 106-94 for 5th win in 7COLUMN: Racing or entertainment?
