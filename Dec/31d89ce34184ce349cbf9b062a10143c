HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Municipalities across Connecticut are expected to begin distributing free COVID-19 test kits and N95 masks they’re receiving from the state as soon as Thursday to help blunt the state’s growing surge of cases, fueled in part by the omicron variant.Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday his administration procured about 3 million at-home kits, each containing two tests, and would distribute them to cities and towns, public health departments, school districts and others over the coming weeks. Municipalities, he said, would begin receiving test kits and masks Thursday and allocation would be based on population.New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said he expects his city of about 130,000 will receive 30,000 two-dose test kits. He said the city will provide some to nonprofit agencies that help vulnerable groups, including people who are homeless, and also distribute kits to residents at two mass distribution events Friday and Saturday.ADVERTISEMENTElicker urged people returning to work or school and who will be exposed to others to pick up a test kit, which have been difficult to find due to high demand. N95 masks will also be distributed at those events.Coronavirus pandemicFree COVID tests, N95 masks available Thursday in some areasUS move to shorten COVID-19 isolation stirs confusion, doubtOklahoma governor says he has no plans to receive boosterCalifornia 1st state to top 5M cases amid omicron surgeThe town of Rocky Hill, with a population of more than 20,000, announced it expects to receive 2,610 test kits for distribution beginning Thursday. A statement on the town’s website called it a “short-term, interim solution with a limited number of test kits ... given the increased travel over the holidays.”The town said COVID-19 tests will be limited to residents with an immediate need, such as if they believe they’ve been exposed or have been experiencing symptoms, and if they traveled over the holidays and have been experiencing symptoms. Up to two kits per car or person will be distributed at the town hall and the fire station on Thursday, Friday, and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of next week.Some communities are planning drive-through pickups of kits and masks. In Killingly, for example, tests will be available to motorists in the town hall parking lot on Friday, from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. As in many communities, proof of residency will be required.
