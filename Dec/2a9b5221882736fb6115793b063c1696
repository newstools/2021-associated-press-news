WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation on Wednesday reported 70 more COVID-19 cases and one additional death.The latest numbers pushed the tribe’s total cases since the pandemic began to 40,254 and the known death toll to 1,557 including five delayed reported fatalities.The Arizona Department of Health Services announced Wednesday that the state’s first known confirmed case of the Omicron variant was found in Yavapai County. “Now that the Omicron variant has been found in Arizona, the most proactive step we can take is to get fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and get a booster shot,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a statement. “All of these measures will help to lower the number of infections, hospitalizations and the strain that is currently on our health care system. Our frontline warriors need our help to lower the number of new cases.”Nez has again called for everyone on the vast reservation to get a booster shot and wear masks.The reservation covers 27,000 square miles (70,000 square kilometers) and extends into parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
