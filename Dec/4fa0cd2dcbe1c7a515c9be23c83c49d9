The Baltimore Orioles were nearing a one-year agreement Tuesday night with second baseman Rougned Odor, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.The person spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the deal had not been announced. The 27-year-old Odor spent last season with the New York Yankees, hitting .202 with 15 home runs and 39 RBIs in 102 games.Odor played seven seasons with the Texas Rangers before joining the Yankees. He’s hit just .234 for his career, but he’s produced plenty of power for a middle infielder. Odor hit 33 home runs in 2016, 30 the following year and then 30 again in 2019.The Orioles announced Tuesday that they’d agreed on 2022 contracts with outfielder Anthony Santander, left-hander Paul Fry and right-hander Jorge López, avoiding arbitration. They also sent infielder Richie Martin outright to Triple-A Norfolk and granted right-hander Brooks Kriske his release to pursue an international opportunity.___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
