INDEPENDENCE, Mo. (AP) — The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library & Museum is scheduled to reopen with limited hours on Thursday.The museum in Independence will initially reopen on Thursdays through Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. for those who bought advance tickets online. Visitors will be required to wear masks. The museum reopened in July after a two-year renovation project  but was closed again in October when COVID-19 cases began to increase in Jackson County.“The pandemic has presented a lot of challenges, but we are prepared and anxious to open our doors to make history come to life for our visitors,” museum Director Kurt Graham said. The nearly $30 million renovation was the most extensive project at the museum since it was built in 1957. It offers more exhibits and artifacts, along with interactive exhibits, and a new layout that walks visitors through Truman’s life from his Missouri childhood through his presidency and his later years.
