LACONIA, N.H. (AP) — A small plane made an emergency landing at the Laconia Airport after the two-person crew noticed that one of their wheels wasn’t working properly, airport officials said. The plane skidded for about 250 feet on the runway Monday before coming to a rest, The Laconia Daily Sun reported. No one was hurt, and there was little damage.It was an amphibious plane, capable of landing on land or water, but airport manager Marv Emerson said the pilots didn’t want to land on water. He said if they did so and took back off, it was likely water on the bottom of the plane would freeze at a higher altitude, thus causing even more problems.
