LAS VEGAS (AP) — A federal judge has refused to block the masking mandate imposed by the school district for metro Las Vegas to combat the spread of the coronavirus and dismissed a lawsuit filed by two students’ parents.U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey on Wednesday denied the request for a preliminary injunction, saying that the parents didn’t establish a viable legal basis for their lawsuit’s challenge to the Clark County School District’s mandate for students and staff.The parents contended that the masking mandate violated their fundamental rights as parents, including making medical decisions for their children. The parents also said they were left out of the process in which the policies were adopted.Dorey’s 22-page ruling said the “perceived wrongs” cited by the challenge didn’t violate any constitutional rights. The ruling also said the parents’ lawyers denied in court that there was a COVID-19 pandemic though it was acknowledged by the World Health Organization, the White House and the U.S. Supreme Court.One of the parents’ lawyers, Sigal Chattah, said on Twitter that the ruling would be appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
