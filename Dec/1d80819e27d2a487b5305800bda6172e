France’s CAC 40 edged up 0.2% in early trading to 7,155.68, while Germany’s DAX added 0.3% to 15,878.65. Britain’s FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,372.10. U.S. shares were set for gains, with Dow futures up nearly 0.1% to 26,200.00. S&P 500 futures were little changed, up less than 0.1% at 4,783.25.
