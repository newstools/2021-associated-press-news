A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Friday:GERMANYLeipzig coach Jesse Marsch will miss the team’s visit to Union Berlin in the Bundesliga as the American remains in isolation following a positive test for the coronavirus. Marsch has been sending in tactical messages from afar but it’s not clear who’ll be on the sideline after the club said his assistant Achim Beierlorzer also tested positive. Players Willi Orban and Hugo Novoa remain in isolation, while goalkeeper Péter Gulácsi and defender Mohamed Simakan are available again. Striker Yussuf Poulsen is out of isolation but has a calf injury. The virus outbreak is the latest blow to a Leipzig team struggling to rebuild after selling key players in the offseason. Union is sixth and Leipzig is eighth in the 18-team league.SPAINAlavés visits Granada aiming to keep improving in the Spanish league after its poor start to the season. Javier Calleja’s side looked like it was set to spend most of the season in the relegation zone after losing seven of its first eight games. But Alavés has only one loss its last seven, including a victory at lower-division Unami in the Copa del Rey this week. Striker Joselu Mato has played a large part in that turnaround, scoring six of his seven goals this season in recent games. The Basque Country side is in 15th place before the trip to southern Spain. Granada is two points back in 16th. Granada coach Robert Moreno will miss the game serving the second of a two-game suspension for protesting during a loss to Real Madrid three rounds ago.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
