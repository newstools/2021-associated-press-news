With COVID-19 outbreaks for a variety of NFL teams, figuring out who will be on the field is as difficult as predicting who will win games. Those issues begin with Thursday night’s prime-time and big-time matchup in the AFC West between the Chiefs (9-4) and Chargers (8-5). Kansas City, which has won six straight games to move atop the division it has dominated the past five seasons, placed defensive tackle Chris Jones in the COVID-19 protocol on Tuesday. Jones has been a catalyst for the team’s defensive resurgence.Wide receiver Josh Gordon has also tested positive.“When you’re down the stretch run you have to take it serious,” Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said, “because you want to be available. It’s just like any injury you would get at this point. You want to do whatever you can to be available to the team. Whether that’s distancing in the locker room or with your family, we understand it’s part of the world.ADVERTISEMENT“Do the best you can to help yourself and help the guy next to you so that you can be available.”The Chargers, who beat KC in September, put offensive tackle Rashawn Slater on the COVID-19 list, while star receiver Keenan Allen and backup center Scott Quessenberry had positive tests last week and remain on it.Coronavirus pandemicUS COVID death toll hits 800,000, a year into vaccine driveColleges go back to drawing board — again — to fight COVIDVaccine alliance chief: Omicron could trigger 'Inequity 2.0'A retro feel to Biden's plan for covering OTC virus testingKansas City, ranked fourth in the AP Pro32, is a 3-point favorite at No. 9 Los Angeles.
