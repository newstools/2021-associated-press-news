Kevin Bossard, assistant chief of operations with the Olympia Fire Department, told The Olympian the building is a total loss.Among the other buildings nearby that were damaged were Pete Lea’s Automotive Medical Center, Union Gospel Vision Clinic, Revival Motors and Coffee, and August Creative, a web design consultant.City Manager Jay Burney in a statement  called the fire a “devastating blow for the entire community.”ADVERTISEMENTHe said fire officials confirmed that a family living in one of the buildings was safe but lost their home and belongings.“We are enormously grateful that no lives were lost, and no one was injured,” Burney said. He also said officials do not yet know what caused the blaze.Bossard said the damage is at least $1 million, which means the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will assist the investigation into the origin and cause of the fire.
