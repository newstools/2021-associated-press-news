VERMILLION, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota’s reserves increased 42% in one year thanks to an influx of federal COVID-19 relief dollars, according to a new report.South Dakota Public Broadcasting reported  Thursday that the state’s 2021 comprehensive financial report shows the state took in $62 million more than expected in revenue and spent $29.2 million less than budgeted. Total reserves grew from $215.9 million in 2020 to $307.1 million last year. Revenue increased from $4.5 billion to $6.1 billion. The report says the biggest factor was $1.2 billion in pandemic-related grants the state received from the federal government. A growing economy and the construction industry also contributed to increased revenue. State spending also increased, from $4.3 billion to $5.6 billion. Most of the increase can be attributed to spending COVID-19 relief funds, the report found. ADVERTISEMENTGov. Kristi Noem said the state needs to be cautious about spending in the face of rising inflation. She has proposed keeping at least 14% of the state budget in reserves.Coronavirus pandemicSuper maxis Black Jack, LawConnect duel in Sydney to HobartNHL set to resume after 6-day break, eyes new CDC guidanceOmicron, storms disrupt air travel for 4th consecutive dayNYC vaccination mandate for the private sector takes effectThe report also noted nearly 30% of the budget funded human and social services; about 23% went to pandemic response; about 20% went to education; and almost 13% went to transportation.Spending by tourists increased dramatically, rising 31% from October 2020 to October 2021.
