The second-year running back is the NFL’s leading rusher -- and he’s on a history-seeking quest. If he runs for 100 yards and scores a TD for the ninth time this season, he’ll tie Earl Campbell, Terrell Davis, Larry Johnson and LaDainian Tomlinson for No. 4 in NFL single-season history.

The quarterback earned his second Pro Bowl selection on Wednesday but didn’t play like one in last weekend’s lopsided loss to the Lions. Murray wasn’t terrible against Detroit, completing 23 of 41 passes for 257 yards, one touchdown and one interception, but the Cardinals need more. They also need the third-year QB to be careful with the ball because the Colts lead the NFL with a plus-14 turnover differential.KEY MATCHUP: Colts QB Carson Wentz vs. Arizona pass rush. Wentz didn’t need to do much through the air against the Patriots as the Colts built a big early lead and stayed on the ground for the rest of the game. The Colts will probably need more production against the Cardinals, who have two of the league’s top pass rushers in Chandler Jones and Markus Golden. The Cardinals have 37 sacks as a team, fifth in the league.KEY INJURIES: Indy is relatively healthy heading into Week 16. Safety Andrew Sendejo entered the concussion protocol following Saturday’s game and it’s unclear if he’ll play this weekend. CB Rock Ya-Sin went on the reserve/COVID-19 list. But the biggest question centers on starting center Ryan Kelly, who didn’t play last week following the death of his newborn daughter. He didn’t practice Tuesday. ... Arizona WR Rondale Moore (ankle), RB James Conner (heel) and DL Jordan Phillips (knee) didn’t practice on Wednesday.

STATS AND STUFF: Indianapolis has won five of its last six and now holds the No. 5 spot in the AFC playoff chase. ... Taylor needs one 100-yard game to tie Edgerrin James for the second most in Colts history in one season.
